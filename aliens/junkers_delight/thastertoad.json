            "html": "Long ago, the red planet of Akiton enjoyed prosperity as the major source of thasteron, a volatile mineral that could be refined into starship fuel. When vessels around the galaxy switched to Drift engines for long-distance travel, Akiton\u2019s economy collapsed, and the thasteron mines and refineries were abandoned. But thasteron was always an infamously dirty fuel with a history of causing environmental damage. Even after the abandonment, large quantities of the mineral remained within the planet\u2019s crust, and this raw substance spurred the mutation that created thastertoads from simple tailless lizards.<br/><br/> Over many generations, the beasts grew in size, and their skin began to exude an impure form of thasteron that formed plates along their backs. They graduated from feeding on insects to larger animals, such as rats and other vermin, catching prey with their long tongues. Unlike other toads, thastertoads aren\u2019t amphibious; they were named by space goblins, who cared little about scientific taxonomy and endured the grumpy personalities of these creatures to (partially) domesticate them. Space goblins who reside in and near Akiton\u2019s fields of crashed starships often keep thastertoads as pets and guard animals."
