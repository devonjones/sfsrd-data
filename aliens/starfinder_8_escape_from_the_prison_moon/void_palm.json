This plant creature is exceedingly rare, and the lack of information about its biology allows it to surprise oblivious explorers. When a suitably large living creature wanders nearby, a void palm plunges the area around it into magical darkness while simultaneously interrupting gravity\u2019s normal function. Creatures caught in this area might become unable to propel themselves out of range of the void palm\u2019s lashing fronds\u2014something the plant deliberately makes more difficult by using its leaves to sweep the area around it clear of debris that might be used as handholds or counterbalance.<br/><br/> Though they are rare, void palms are found across the galaxy. Their unique method of reproduction lends itself well to a slow but inexorable colonization of the stars. Once a year, a void palm produces a brilliant blue seed at the end of each of its stalks over the course of a week, and then it flings its progeny into the sky. The remarkable seeds each carry the void palm\u2019s supernatural ability to ignore gravity, allowing the momentum imparted from their parent to carry them off the void palm\u2019s planet and onto new ones. This unique ability makes void palm seeds rare and expensive curios.<br/><br/> The typical void palm is 15 feet tall and weighs around 1,000 pounds."
