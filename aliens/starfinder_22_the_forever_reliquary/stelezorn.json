            "html": "Stelezorns are fey creatures who make their homes in densely populated areas, integrating with local cultures and building personal connections. Appearing as a member of the local humanoid populace, these charismatic creatures have little difficulty making fast friends and even faster rivals with their quick wit and flippant attitudes. As consummate rabble-rousers, they inevitably cause trouble for the communities that receive them.<br/><br/> The cause for the stelezorn\u2019s aggravating tendencies lies within their unusual diet: they feed on the wrathful emotions of sapient beings. Stelezorns have a strong attunement to such emotions, absorbing the anger and frustration of nearby creatures in much the same way that plants gain nutrients from sunlight. They feed on nearby creatures, usually making passive-aggressive remarks that frustrate people around them while avoiding physical confrontation until such altercations become inevitable. Most stelezorns maintain a broad and carefully cultivated social network to keep their feeding from overtaxing any one individual, a process they refer to as \u201ctending the garden.\u201d<br/><br/> In contrast to the creatures they provoke, stelezorns endeavor to maintain composure. They see themselves as masters of their own emotions and consider themselves to be better than anyone who falls prey to their manipulations. In truth, they\u2019re no less prone to outbursts than most humanoids. Their control places them in either stoic calm or frothing rage, but their emotions rarely see any middle ground. When threatened, a stelezorn can tap into reserves of siphoned wrath to grow into a hulking brute, but they do so only out of need, as such outbursts cause the creature to lose face among their own kind.<br/><br/> In their natural form, a stelezorn looks like an androgynous, green-skinned humanoid with dark hair and a pair of swept-back horns."
