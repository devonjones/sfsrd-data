When the Swarm needs to pierce solid stone\u2014either to reach precious natural resources or to invade an underground fortification\u2014it employs moliteras, large and sturdy components that look like living heavy industrial equipment. Moliteras have armored exoskeletons featuring dark blotches, four legs, and two shovel-like arms. These arms have pointed spikes along the edges that also make moliteras dangerous combatants. Using little-understood muscles and nerve endings, moliteras are constantly and subtly vibrating at frequencies that soften the rock they tunnel through, and they can focus these emanations in an offensive capacity when necessary. Survivors of Swarm attacks report sensing these vibrations moments before the moliteras break through nearby stone walls, with hordes of other Swarm creatures following behind them."

The Swarm moves from planet to planet in tremendous organic hive-ships, reducing each so-called \u201cfeeder world\u201d to a barren husk incapable of supporting life, and occasionally altering its own DNA in the process to take on qualities from that world\u2019s species. Once it has consumed everything of use on a planet, the Swarm moves on, not bothering to hold territory.<br/><br/> Ironically, one of the most violent races in the galaxy also birthed one of the most peaceful, as a mutation within a sub-hive gave life to the shirrens, who broke away to form a new species. The Swarm is notorious not just because of the invasion that finally ended hostilities between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, but also thanks to the warnings of shirrens, who understand the Swarm\u2019s might and its hunger as no other race can.<br/><br/> While individual components of the Swarm have some form of intelligence\u2014or at least a set of complex programmed behaviors that resembles intellect\u2014they cannot generally be reasoned with in any fashion. Swarm components rarely communicate with other creatures, as they see every alien entity as either a food source or a threat. The Swarm\u2019s morale is unbreakable, and while individual components might retreat for tactical reasons, fear is utterly unknown to the Swarm and its components.<br/><br/> The Swarm rarely wields manufactured weapons, instead integrating biotechnology grown or grafted onto component creatures. Because of its constant genetic upgrading and experimentation, the Swarm encompasses components with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and capabilities, from the mighty dreadlancers to the microscopic, bloodstream-infesting toxicytes."

(Such awareness can spread along a \u201cchain\u201d of Swarm creatures under appropriate circumstances, potentially alerting distant Swarm creatures). In addition, once per round when within 30 feet of another Swarm creature, a Swarm creature can roll twice and take the better result on a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect.",
