            "html": "Those who return from Absalom Station\u2019s Ghost Levels speak of haunting cryptids that feel their way through the tunnels with tapping tendrils and whose calls summon death. Known as undershrikes, these lanky creatures aimlessly patrol the Ghost Levels, slipping past obstacles almost like ghosts. To the myriad strange life-forms native to the Ghost Levels, undershrikes may as well be phantoms; the two barely seem to notice each other and respect one another when they do. However, undershrikes are territorial around unfamiliar beings, stalking them before either skewering the intruders just outside the Ghost Levels or screeching to attract local fauna to dispatch the trespassers. Rarely, a respectful explorer becomes accepted by undershrikes, who ignore the traveler as if they were one of the Ghost Level inhabitants.<br/><br/> When slain, an undershrike\u2019s body dissolves into the surrounding architecture, only to reform elsewhere on the station with its memories intact. Some of these reborn creatures develop a taste for revenge, slinking out from the Ghost Levels like eyeless revenants to track, torment, and murder their killers.<br/><br/> Undershrikes\u2019 origins are a mystery, with the most popular theories being they were convicts banished to the Ghost Levels during the Gap and transformed by something within the haunted halls. Undershrikes speak an unpredictable array of languages, yet seem to understand one another no matter which they\u2019re speaking, often cryptically discussing people, landmarks, and events unknown to history. Undershrikes who speak the same language seem so rare it might be there\u2019s only one such creature per language, reborn repeatedly."
