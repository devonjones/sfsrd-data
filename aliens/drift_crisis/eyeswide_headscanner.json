            "html": "The Eyeswide Agency uses divination magic along with careful infosphere research to dig up leads on missing people, including those lost to the Drift Crash, but those leads require follow-up that can\u2019t be performed from agency headquarters on Absalom Station. Instead, most fieldwork falls to a veritable army of psychic investigators, known across the galaxy as headscanners.<br/> The typical headscanner is a self-reliant, rough-and-tumble detective used to operating in remote locations and, when necessary, outside the law. Seldom violent or cruel by nature, they\u2019re nonetheless jaded from years of exposure to the galaxy\u2019s seedy underbelly and they tend to have a dim view of others. Most headscanners presume other people will always act in the most selfish and profitable manner possible, no matter who they hurt in the process. Of course, given a headscanner\u2019s typical caseload, this rather pessimistic perspective is all too often proven right.<br/> A headscanner almost always works alone\u2014the resources of the Eyeswide Agency are simply stretched too thin for the luxury of multiple agents working together, and they rarely subcontract or partner up with non-agents. Sometimes, however, two missing persons cases converge and lead a pair of headscanners to become temporary partners. Similarly, their company-issued credit allowance is infamously insufficient, and virtually every successful headscanner relies on a web of trusted contacts to provide tips, transportation, safe houses, and backup\u2014not to mention discounts on needed goods and services. Headscanners often have a favorite weapon they rely on for intimidation or protection as much as any actual show of force.<br/> Their line of work, combined with their tendency to play their cards close to the chest, often puts headscanners at odds with other investigators, even those with closely aligned goals. Many groups of galactic adventurers, chasing down leads or attempting to crack a case, have crossed paths with an uncooperative Eyeswide agent on the same trail, sometimes making mistaken assumptions about the agent\u2019s involvement in the case. While such misunderstandings are often resolved without violence, headscanners in search of a payday are rarely above slyly misdirecting such do-gooders\u2019 attentions to false leads and dead ends.<br/> The Eyeswide Agency has historically recruited most headscanners from well\u2011known telepathic species in the Pact Worlds, such as barathus, lashuntas, and shirrens, as well as from across the galaxy\u2014especially those with extraordinary psychic gifts besides. In the wake of the Drift Crisis and the immense increase in demand for headscanner services, recruitment has spiked and rumors abound of lowered standards for qualifications. The agency has begun to explore monetary rewards for those who reveal poseurs masquerading as headscanners, hoping to make a quick credit off the desperate and trusting.<br/> Headscanners can manifest a wide array of psychic powers; the spell-like abilities listed in the stat block above are just a representative example. Precogs in particular make apt headscanners, though a wide variety of specializations, from brawny physicality to technomagical aptitude, can come in handy in the investigations these agents typically tackle."
