Limbicates are clusters of fear, hatred, and mischief drawn from the Ethereal Plane by Drift travel and shaped by their new home into sadistic tricksters that feed on emotional distress. Seemingly without scruples, they haunt cityscapes and provoke reckless, violent abandon before fading from sight. The greater the trauma, the more often a limbicate can split and just one can quickly multiply into a plague of criminal activity.<br/><br/> Periodically, a well-fed limbicate doesn\u2019t split but instead retreats and cocoons itself to metamorphose. Sometimes the limbicate that emerges has phantasmal limbs, as though the creature\u2019s slowly developing a corporeal body. Other times it transforms into a wholly different creature, suggesting this current form is but one stage in a complex life cycle."
