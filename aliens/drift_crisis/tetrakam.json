            "html": "Every faith has its secrets, and hidden to all but Triune\u2019s highest\u2011ranking priests is a troubling scrap of apocrypha: a fourth being sought to join with the All-Code centuries ago. Whether by veto of other three deities, some intrinsic incompatibility, or another explanation altogether, the fourth being was denied. Ever since, it has remained hidden, watching enviously from afar, occasionally engaging with the cosmos through its agents. Known as tetrakams, most witnesses refer to them colloquially as \u201cseekers.\u201d<br/><br/> Tetrakams vary widely in their appearance, ranging from humanoids to fiendish cyborgs to floating cityscapes. The only consistent element is that each has three similar features with a clear indication that there should be a fourth feature that\u2019s now absent or never existed, such as an angelic being wearing a four-pointed crown that\u2019s conspicuously missing most of one peak, or a robot with three eyes and one damaged, empty socket.<br/><br/> As if echoing their creators\u2019 longing to join Triune, tetrakams crave other beings\u2019 thoughts and adoration\u2014 especially from Triunites. They periodically gather followers or try to join existing organizations, though these unions often end in tragedy when the seeker\u2019s overwhelming desire for integration melts its new friends\u2019 minds or drives the tetrakam to messily try to fuse its allies to its body. Those who successfully ally with tetrakams often do so by acquiescing to their increasingly elaborate schemes to petition, trick, or force Triune to adopt a fourth constituent deity, though the creatures struggle to recall the identity of this wronged god.<br/><br/> These beings are especially prevalent and at home in the Drift, likely drawing comfort from that plane\u2019s figurative proximity to Triune."
