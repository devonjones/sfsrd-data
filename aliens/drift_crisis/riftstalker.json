            "html": "Although planes of existence are impossibly distant from each other, supernatural stresses can tear their metaphysical boundaries, creating planar breaches that connect the two realms. Not only can a planar breach draw creatures from another plane, but the energies sometimes coalesce into strange predators known as riftstalkers. These creatures instinctively patrol their unstable territory and stalk prey. This fuels a popular theory that riftstalkers aren\u2019t independent creatures so much as extensions of their breach, like white blood cells maintaining the integrity of their home by destroying foreign bodies.<br/><br/> As a breach heals and closes, riftstalkers become increasingly aggravated and aggressive, desperately clinging to their ephemeral ecosystem. Under most circumstances, a sealed breach causes any riftstalkers to wither, sublimate, and die, unless they can find an equally vibrant home. Attempts to safely relocate these creatures\u2014for study or to save them\u2014are risky, because they often behave erratically and destructively when separated from their ephemeral homes. Riftstalkers\u2019 features often aesthetically reflect the planes associated with the breach that created them. A breach to Hell might create a riftstalker with a menacing glow and fangs dripping with hellfire, while one from an Elysium breach might be covered in flowers and accompanied by beautiful music. Occasionally two planes\u2019 influence combine to dazzling effect. Even when associated with breaches to aligned outer planes, riftstalkers are often chaotic beings."
