            "html": "Kaukarikis are inquisitive pests named after the sound of their warning vocalizations in the presence of threats; most who interact with the creatures directly prefer to call them by the less endearing moniker of \u201cstingbats.\u201d Primarily frugivores, kaukarikis scamper about in woodland canopies and glide from tree to tree, each troop migrating widely over its claimed territory to exploit seasonal food sources. The creatures readily take advantage of other supplies of food as needed, including insects, young leaves, bark, and even meat on rare occasions. In fact, particularly large troops\u2014 especially those with a newly ascendant alpha female\u2014sometimes organize a hunt to take down modest prey and share the kill to reinforce social bonds within the group.<br/><br/> The creature\u2019s eponymous stinger serves both defensive and offensive purposes. Few predators in the kaukarikis\u2019 range are willing to risk the painful venom, especially because the pests often rally to one another\u2019s defense to mob assailants. This fearsome reputation seems to embolden kaukarikis, which infamously incite each other to harass trespassers as a way of demonstrating bravery and establishing a pecking order within the troop. For all their venom\u2019s power, it isn\u2019t produced directly by the kaukarikis\u2019 bodies; many of their favorite fruits and seeds are toxic, and the creatures\u2019 digestive systems separate and store the poisons within a small venom sac near the tip of the tail. As a result, kaukarikis fed different diets might develop venom that damages a different ability score or lose their poison altogether.<br/><br/> Kaukariki mating habits often coincide with massive feasts of fruits, with the male that consumes the most food being seen as the most desirable mate. The alpha female chooses first from among the potential mates, followed by the other females that have the alpha\u2019s permission. A female that attempts to take a mate without permission is often attacked and driven off by the rest of the troop. Such a kaukariki is then left to fend for herself, and sometimes she becomes the alpha of her own troop.<br/><br/> Kaukarikis are most common on the continent of Ukulam, though on Asana they have adapted to the dominant lashunta city-states by adopting new habits better suited to urban environments. The people of Castrovel err on the side of deterring and dispersing kaukarikis back into the wild, though they don\u2019t hesitate to take more drastic action when a local population gets out of hand. That\u2019s even truer in the famed fruit orchards of southern Asana, where the kaukarikis can be so disruptive that local authorities often incentivize hunting down the creatures to trim their numbers."
