            "html": "Miasma flies are long-bodied insects that are about the size of a small canid. True to their name, miasma flies are often found flitting lazily in clouds of the gaseous metals on which they feed, or skimming the surface of Weydana-2\u2019s mercury lake. Many explorers are drawn to miasma flies\u2019 beautiful coloring and find their graceful movements fascinating to watch, at least from afar: wicked stingers protrude from both ends of the insects\u2019 bodies, and their shimmering wings are lined with spines. Miasma fly stings are extremely painful, producing a sensation comparable to a gunshot wound. Worse, their venom causes severe muscle stiffness and paralysis as it works through the victim\u2019s body.<br/><br/> A dedicated team of xenobiologists have posited a connection between the miasma fly and another creature native to Weydana-2, the cryllapede. Miasma flies congregate when temperatures in their environment dip significantly, arriving in great swarms. After devouring enough nutrients to power metamorphosis\u2014a process that takes only a few days of constant gorging\u2014miasma flies shed their wings, find shelter within crystal formations, and form a chrysalis nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding rock. In a few weeks, the creatures emerge in a new form: a large predatory insect known as a cryllapede, with a chitinous segmented body that mimics the appearance of Weydana-2\u2019s crystalline landscape. Cryllapedes use their sensitive, antennae-like legs to detect the movements of their preferred prey, the ruminant species of Weydana-2. Once they\u2019ve located a herd, they burrow into the ground, pinpoint the exact location of a target, and erupt from the earth in an ambush attack. Cryllapedes lay their eggs in half-devoured corpses. Though they aren\u2019t normally aggressive to humanoids, cryllapedes will attack if threatened or desperate for food."
