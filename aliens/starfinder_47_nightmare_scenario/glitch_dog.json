            "html": "Glitch dogs represent an evolutionary leap from their blink dog ancestors. In their eternal hunt for evil creatures from the Ethereal Plane\u2014their ancestral enemies\u2014blink dogs gradually adapted to enter shifting planar landscapes to find and destroy their quarry. Over generations of evolution, some packs learned to utilize their abilities to enter realms previously unheard of by blink dog sages.<br/> The artificial reality of digital space was one of the emergent planes blink dogs entered. They became glitch dogs, transient beings of virtual spaces dedicated to eliminating digital recreations of phase spiders, as well as corrupted code of all types. Some crusading counter-hackers and technomancers enjoy the companionship of a glitch dog whose trust they\u2019ve gained. Major tech companies have hired them as troubleshooters and living computer countermeasures.<br/> In the physical world, glitch dogs stand about 3 feet tall at the shoulder and resemble sleek, long-eared canines. Their black fur is streaked with dark gray and lit from within by a blue nimbus of energy. Their moods heavily influences their appearances in digital space. Hunting glitch dogs might appear as fearsome wolves or three-headed hellhounds dripping blue fire and snippets of code. Among friendly company, glitch dogs can appear like cuddly dogs lined in azure. Since their existence is split between two realms, glitch dogs\u2019 forms often stutter, their agile legs or bushy tails breaking into digital pixelation surrounded by their internal glow."
