These extraplanar messengers scatter like dandelion seeds in the wind to take root in strange locales, where they messages that bloom in mortal hearts, inspiring them to greatness or calling them to Cynosure.<br/> Cynogerms begin their lives as seeds planted in vast gardens in Cynosure, where they\u2019re tended by azatas and other good outsiders loyal to Desna. They graduate from their gardens once their infancy ends and they\u2019re strong enough to travel the stars on their own.<br/> In keeping with their origins, cynogerms constantly cycle through their three forms, which they can also adopt at will. Their appearance slowly morphs between a dandelion-like seed, a vivid flowering plant, and a colorful butterfly with a wingspan as large as an eagle\u2019s. <br/> Most cynogerms don\u2019t reveal their true names to strangers, but those lucky enough to become acquainted with one might be entrusted with such information. Cynogerms choose their own names, combining colors and musical terminology and often incorporating imagery from dreams. Cynogerm names range from \u201cCrimson Coda\u201d to more elaborate affairs such as \u201cFlight Over Cyan Seas.\u201d"
