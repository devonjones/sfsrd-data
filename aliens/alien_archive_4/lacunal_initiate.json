            "html": "Long before the Gap, a monastic sect on lost Golarion devoted to Casandalee known as the Created worked tirelessly to collect the living memories of other sentient beings in the service of their goddess. These monks vowed to continuously return to the mortal realm through reincarnation until they assembled a complete archive of all conscious experience. The lineage of this ancient order presumably vanished with Golarion, but after Casandalee merged with Brigh and Epoch to form Triune, a new incarnation of the sect emerged with new horizons\u2014the vastness of space\u2014in its sights.<br/><br/> A group of devout androids embarked from Absalom Station on a voyage to the far corners of the Vast, determined to chronicle and preserve the experiences of all alien species. During their centuries-long sojourn, the monks\u2019 beliefs became twisted. Now, these former followers of Casandalee circumvent the natural reincarnation cycle in favor of artificially perpetuating their own consciousnesses. A new living prophet, Novani of the Lacunal Visage, rose to prominence in the order. Under her guidance, the reformed Lacunal disciples seek longevity through undeath, and are obsessed with \u201cpreserving\u201d other beings by collecting their parts and forcibly extracting their memories.<br/><br/> Novani oversees the Lacunal disciples from her holy vessel, Eternal Remembrance, a colossal and heavily armed starship that carries hundreds of her followers as they scour systems for memories to add to their catalog.<br/><br/> The Lacunal disciples\u2019 macabre practices are shocking to outsiders, leading many who hear of the order to believe its original tenets may have been perverted by a malevolent deity such as Urgathoa. Members of the order, however, see themselves as caretakers of knowledge dedicated to an incorruptible cause. Despite Lacunal devotees\u2019 apparent indifference towards the suffering of living beings, most creatures who encounter them survive. Travelers awaken from a stupor missing cybernetic augmentations, having only a vague memory of obsessively building a constructed body at a faceless being\u2019s request. Lacunal disciples don\u2019t actively proselytize, though the prophet Novani always welcomes android converts to join her order\u2019s ranks.<br/><br/> Upon initiation, a Lacunal pledge willingly partakes in a ritual to become undead. Before the initiate abandons their mortality, they construct a new body from scavenged organic and technological parts. The crowning glory of this second form is a secondary head that serves as a receptacle for their consciousness. Once the ritual is complete, their old head shrivels and dies as their soul transfers to the new form. Lacunal disciples carry their old heads as sacred reminders of their previous incarnations, often wearing the heads as intricate garlands around their necks. A few Lacunal apostates prioritize their own personal existence above their order\u2019s cause and conceal one or more of their heads in remote locations to avoid true destruction.<br/><br/> Lacunal disciples are undead androids who typically inhabit a humanoid body shape with visible circuits, and like their living counterparts, the creatures\u2019 individual appearances vary drastically to reflect subtle differences in design, personality, and modification. The number of heads displayed by a Lacunal disciple typically reflects the number of times they\u2019ve thwarted destruction and continued their grim mission."
