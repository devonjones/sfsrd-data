They are dark in coloration, most often black or dull green, but they have bright crystalline teeth and spikes along their spines. A radiation drake has a draconic appearance, with a long neck and tail, wings, and powerful hind legs, but lacks front legs.<br/><br/> In addition to its fearsome bite, a radiation drake can unleash gouts of superheated radioactive material. However, this technique requires considerable practice. Hatchlings can do little more than drool fiery puddles\u2014an ability that they quickly learn to control lest they burn themselves. Juveniles practice regularly, leaving scorched scars in their territory as they swallow small stones, irradiate the pebbles, and learn to regurgitate the radioactive projectiles. Yet only the adults truly master the techniques, spitting fire with precision without relying on any supplemental material whatsoever. These radioactive attacks all cause the crystalline spikes along a radiation drake\u2019s spine to glow with white-hot light.<br/><br/> Radiation drakes lay their eggs in semi-molten surfaces, such as stone, plastics, or even ceramic the drakes vitrify with their breath. Where possible, a radiation drake situates its nest near sources of radiation, such as nuclear power stations, naturally radioactive rock formations, or even the bodies of fallen kaiju\u2014 enormous creatures of unknown origin. Once laid, a drake egg\u2019s maturation depends on how much radiation it can absorb, with heavily toxic environments fueling rapid development.<br/><br/> Yet whelps don\u2019t come only from adult radiation drakes. Their eggs periodically appear on worlds with no prior radiation drake sightings, suggesting that under certain conditions, other drakes\u2019 eggs can mutate and hatch radiation drakes.<br/><br/> Radiation drakes rarely bother to do anything but act out on their most instinctive impulses unless driven to do so or guided by a worthy ally. Those allies are few and far between, as the drakes are violently territorial and radioactive, and they rarely form bonds with creatures. Ellicoths occasionally form friendly bands with radiation drakes, with the latter perching atop the spindly beasts and periodically dragging prey to drop before the ellicoths to maintain the peace. Hespers occasionally recruit radiation drakes, relying on the latter\u2019s raw strength to access well-defended reactors and other technology. However, the alliances are usually short\u2011lived, as the drakes rarely have the patience to act as guards, usually instead laying waste to the devices the hespers so desperately want."
