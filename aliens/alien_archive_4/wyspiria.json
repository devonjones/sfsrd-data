            "html": "Spectra are a race of outsiders native to the hyperspace plane of the Drift, concerned with technological growth and advancement, the protection of the Drift, and the spread of Drift technology across the galaxy. Encounters with the relatively new group of outsiders have occurred with greater frequency over the 300 years since they joined the Great Beyond. In recent decades, two new types of spectra have begun to appear: wyspirias and sondrias. It\u2019s unknown whether these spectra existed in the Drift all along, simply unobserved by mortals, or if Triune newly created them to further some fresh purpose.<br/><br/> Wyspirias, often compared to iridias as emissaries of the Drift, are dispatched across the galaxy, possibly on missions from Triune themself, or perhaps on behalf of the mysterious hierarchy of spectra. They stand 7 feet tall with chassis of multicolored glass, and a multitude of coiled, rootlike tentacles cascading from their waists. As a result of the resemblance they bear to floating trees, they are sometimes called trees of knowledge. Wyspirias use their tendrils to plug themselves into people and machines alike\u2014a direct connection that allows them to quickly transfer huge quantities of data between connected people and devices. Whereas iridias come to the Prime Material Plane offering gifts of knowledge and technology to mortals, many believe wyspirias do the opposite, collecting libraries of secrets and information about the galaxy for the unseen purposes of spectra. Rarely, wyspirias are said to appear during the peace talks of warring civilizations, connecting the opposing delegates and enabling them to understand each other directly. Many believe these spectra intervene only when they deem the risk of losing technology or information from a conflict too great.<br/><br/> Sondrias are a new variety of spectra primarily encountered inside the Drift. They are small and sharply featured, with six arms, razor talons, and round, flat, owlish faces. Sometimes called Drift pixies, their presence is always accompanied by a grainy, low-pitched hum or buzzing noise. Sondrias use their own voices more often than other types of spectra, and sequences of sondrias have a habit of speaking at the same time in overlapping sentences that are difficult to pick apart. Like the larger and more formidable aspecnas, sondrias patrol the Drift to help lost travelers and rescue marooned escape pods or starships whose Drift engines malfunction, latching onto the vessels and using their slip drives to boost them back to the Material Plane. It\u2019s rumored sequences of sondria can also offer Triune\u2019s blessing to those killed during Drift travel or in service of the All Code\u2019s agenda\u2014by reincarnating them as androids."

Each round at the start of their turn, the target must succeed at a Will save to remain aware of their real surroundings. On a failure, they are staggered until the start of their next turn. The wyspiria can take a move action at the beginning of their turn each round to maintain all of their connections; otherwise all their connections end. The appendages have 15 feet of reach, and attached targets\u2019 movement is restricted to within 15 feet of the wyspiria. The appendage can be detached with a successful Strength check (DC 15) as a standard action, or with a successful attack against the appendage (same AC as the wyspiria). Targets can also attempt a Strength check to break free any time the wyspiria moves; this requires no action. On a failure, the target moves with the wyspiria. A wyspiria can maintain up to ten connections at one time.",
