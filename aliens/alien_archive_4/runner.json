Where new developments interfere with this ideal, epokasites try to preserve historic machinery, even sabotaging new technologies in a stubborn defense of the old ways.<br/><br/> Epokasites take two common forms: fixers and runners. Fixers rarely stand at more than a foot tall, whereas runners exceed heights of 5 feet. Sensory papillae cover their noses, helping the fey detect a variety of stimuli, which they normally use to locate technology from their favored time period, such as hints of forge charcoal, motor oil on a combustion engine, or the tang of early lasers. Each epokasite adopts slang, clothing, and gear appropriate to their favored era, from chainmail, hides, outdated suits, or alchemists\u2019 coveralls.<br/><br/> Being shy creatures, fixers prefer to operate out of sight. Runners instead thrive on infiltrating the modern societies they so disdain, donning disguises and stealing credentials to access delicate technologies. Both epokasite varieties regularly sneak onto starships or into sensitive facilities as stowaways in the guise of hired hands, largely so that they can sabotage the technological affronts to their favored eras\u2014acts they consider entirely helpful and for which they expect a reward from any who discover them in action. Rarely, epokasites might live openly among a community, most often in groups of stubborn luddites, historical reenactors, or closely-aligned cosplayers. In those settings, they might act as excitable consultants and crafters.<br/><br/> An epokasite most often imprints on the culture and time period in which they came into existence on the Material Plane. Less often, an epokasite might wander until they read about or experience an era that impresses them, thereafter adopting that period as their focus.<br/><br/> The most tragic and contentious of all epokasites are those who embody eras now lost to the Gap. These distraught individuals rarely maintain more than a memento or faint memory from that lost time, and they strive to piece together whatever they can, sometimes teaming up with Starfinders and other scholars."
