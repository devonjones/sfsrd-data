            "html": "Powerful reptilian predators, plasmalisks rely on blasts of plasma to hunt, scorching their prey and feasting on the remains. The key to their power stems from their ion cores\u2014 this specialized organ combines depressurization, chemical catalysts, and tiny nuclear reactions to ionize metals like lithium, sodium, and potassium. Plasmalisks use their constant plasma furnace as both a weapon and a power source. Not only do wisps of the plasma escape when plasmalisks bite, but they can also expel gouts of the ionized gases or channel the energy into creatures that meet their gazes. Their prey often boil alive, yet stronger victims smolder for hours, attracting scavengers before exploding and littering the area with ample food for canny plasmalisks to consume.<br/><br/> Plasmalisks typically measure 12 feet from snout to tail and weigh about 4,500 pounds. These ponderous creatures rarely move at any pace faster than an amble even with their eight legs; this sluggishness stems from their alien metabolisms. Rather than draw power from mitochondria, plasmalisks\u2019 cells are fueled almost entirely by a constant field of energy from their ion cores. When not actively hunting, their reaction rates slow. Plasmalisks often enter a torpor state in which they maintain just enough of their metabolism to restart the reactions once necessary. Their scales radiate a portion of their energy, both illuminating their surroundings and creating an electroreception field through which plasmalisks can sense nearby creatures and objects. Hibernating plasmalisks create almost no light, whereas fully active ones practically incandesce. Adults can modulate their light\u2019s color and pattern to communicate, making nighttime mating displays visible for miles. In rare cases, whole mosaics gather together to glow in a reflection of the sky\u2019s colors, attracting daring explorers and tourists who chase meteorological events in the hopes of spotting this behavior.<br/><br/> Due to these resource-intensive actions, plasmalisks display ectothermic habits, sunning themselves or even basking on exposed cliffs during lightning storms or auroras to absorb ionized particles. These events generally calm plasmalisks, even to the point that they tolerate visitors and onlookers. Yet should plasmalisks absorb too much energy, they become moody and agitated, recklessly cavorting or hunting in an attempt to burn off the high. Reactors, power stations, and forges often draw the creatures from miles around, ultimately leading to the destruction of such locations once the plasmalisks overindulge and rampage.<br/><br/> After a successful hunt, a plasmalisk primarily feeds on the ionized particles of its victims. However, the creature also requires conventional nutrients, albeit in smaller quantities than expected for sustaining its size; typically, a plasmalisk procures such nourishment by consuming its prey\u2019s still-smoldering bodies. A plasmalisk\u2019s greatest drive is its need for key minerals. Inexpertly dug furrows attest to a plasmalisk\u2019s foraging, and it can migrate as much as 200 miles to reach mineral sources\u2014no matter who or what lies in the way.<br/><br/> Plasmalisks usually lay just a pair of eggs, depositing the second one roughly a week after the first, but well-fed females occasionally lay larger, even-numbered clutches. The translucent eggs glow with their parents\u2019 ionizing energy, periodically fluctuating as the developing embryos shift and dream. Half of the eggs always hatch early, and these first hatchlings quickly cannibalize one of their less-developed clutch mates. Although macabre, this practice is essential to young plasmalisks\u2019 survival, as hatchlings lack both the nutrients and activation energy to properly develop their ion cores. Genetic studies show that the slain sibling isn\u2019t fully digested; the survivor\u2019s body directly incorporates portions of the sibling\u2019s organs and DNA, creating a chimeric whole. Collectors delight in capturing plasmalisk eggs\u2014no easy feat given the parents\u2019 tireless nest patrols. A little jury-rigged hardware can transform a healthy egg into a mobile (yet quite unethical) power station capable of restoring up to 100 charges or even jump-starting a damaged starship before killing the creature."
