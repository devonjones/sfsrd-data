            "html": "Though now the symbiotic primary inhabitants of the three moons of Hadrogess\u2014a desolate world in the Vast\u2014 Hadrogaans once lived on the planet itself, millennia ago. They possess knowledge of their life on Hadrogess\u2019s surface, and their departure from it, that date back to before the Gap, but even so, much of that history has been lost. Obsessive historians have reconstructed pieces of their history, but uncertainties and inconsistencies still plague the field.<br/><br/> All hadrogaans know for sure is that some catastrophe caused the planet\u2019s atmosphere to begin slowly leaking into space. Faced with extinction, they scrambled for a possible solution. Following a series of frantic and unsanctioned experiments, a team of fringe scientists discovered a sapient crystal that grew deep beneath the planet\u2019s crust, one that could merge with a hadrogaan body in a process that\u2014in most cases\u2014 led to greater intellect and insight. These scientists claimed that the crystalline organisms, collectively called kallestrine, not only willingly participated in these experiments, but that they had sent psychic signals to the scientists\u2014leading the latter to discover them\u2014and had even proposed merging the entire hadrogaan species with kallestrine. Successful merging caused a rapid processing-power expansion that many felt could propel the two organisms into a new era of enlightenment, and in fact, many hadrogaans saw this way as their only hope for salvation.<br/><br/> Modern hadrogaans know that most of their people accepted the merging and somehow found a way\u2014before the advent of starships\u2014to settle their planet\u2019s three moons. In their new symbiotic forms, hadrogaans formed a society dedicated to science, philosophy, progress, and utilitarianism in all matters. Their advancements positioned them to embrace Drift travel soon after receiving Triune\u2019s signal, and whenever possible, hadrogaans seek positive relations with alien life\u2014but should peace talks fail, they have no qualms with swift and efficient military solutions.<br/><br/> Most hadrogaans stand at about 8 feet tall with long limbs, thin bodies, and elongated fingers. Large hollows perforate their torsos, limbs, and sometimes their necks and faces, each filled with glimmering crystals\u2014the organism that hadrogaans merged with during the Gap. The merging altered the species\u2019 genetic makeup, and hadrogaan children are born with these crystalline hollows, which can grow and shift over time.<br/><br/> From infancy, hadrogaans have a constant internal dialogue between their organic brains and the crystalline neural network inhabiting their body. The crystal pushes them to consider the practicality and utility of every action, as well as that of any person or object they might encounter. What is its purpose? How might it be of use? At what point does its usefulness outweigh its drawbacks? This extreme practicality isn\u2019t always logical or in the individual\u2019s best interest, but most hadrogaans agree that attempting to drastically alter their symbiotic relationship would prove detrimental to the species as a whole.<br/><br/> For reasons unknown\u2014the most common theory being that the initial merging of organisms didn\u2019t always work as intended\u2014hadrogaans are dimorphic. Luma hadrogaans have more dominant crystalline features and frailer bodies, while doluma hadrogaans have fewer crystals\u2014sometimes only one or two hollows\u2014but far more bulk. While genetically distinct, these two subspecies can still reproduce with the other. No consistent pattern exists for the expression of this dimorphism in offspring, regardless of the parents\u2019 types.<br/><br/> Luma hadrogaans possess the increased intellect that was, in theory, the goal of the merging. The crystals of doluma hadrogaans, on the other hand, tend to instead reinforce their musculature. Despite these physical differences, hadrogaans of both subspecies can serve in a variety of societal roles, though luma hadrogaans lean toward positions that require strategic thinking or deep and rapid analysis. Outside their home systems, they typically work as explorers, scientists, and diplomats. Starfaring dolumas, on the other hand, more likely eke out their living as lone thrill-seekers, mercenaries, or bounty hunters.<br/><br/> Most hadrogaans see no practical purpose in returning to their home planet and have made few efforts to directly study or explore the surface of Hadrogess, instead preferring to focus on future developments for their current lunar homes. A few iconoclastic philosophers and scientists have directed their attention to the planet, however, and the discovery of obliterated cities, desolate landscapes, and signs of a once-extant mutant population hint at a possibly more sinister past."
