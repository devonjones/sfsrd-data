            "html": "Azlanti battle robots can be found at the front of most Azlanti Star Empire advances. Their unwavering loyalty and disposability, coupled with their propensity to self-destruct amid enemy soldiers, makes them invaluable on the battlefield. These robots resemble members of the iconic Aeon Guard with exposed gears and pistons, which call back to the wondrous clockwork creations of the ancient Azlanti people of lost Golarion. Further, these constructs are incapable of directly assaulting anyone of pure Azlanti heritage. However, field tests have shown that exceptional disguises can trick the robots. Azlanti roboticists are hard at work correcting this flaw. Mass-produced in imperial factories, each Azlanti robot stands 7 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds."

They\u2019re often employed in situations where the risks to living beings are too great or emotional responses are a hindrance\u2014notably murder and war.<br/><br/> Assassin robots are killing machines useful for stealthy slayings or gruesome public displays. A user can program targets into the robot, dispatch the unit, and rest assured. The robot relentlessly pursues its quarry, fearing nothing and using microfiber setae on its hands and feet to traverse vertical and horizontal surfaces with ease. Whether it succeeds, fails, escapes, or suffers destruction, the robot leaves little evidence behind\u2014an assassin robot that is captured or destroyed automatically purges its memory and burns out its sensitive hardware components, making tracing the robot\u2019s mission and origin extremely difficult.<br/><br/> Typical assassin robots are 6 feet tall, weigh 300 pounds, and use the weapons detailed in the stat block on page 108, but they can be outfitted with other armaments as a mission requires. In particular, assassin robots on missions where more subtlety is called for use needler pistols stocked with poisoned darts.<br/><br/> There is nothing subtle, however, about a siege robot. These machines serve as artificially intelligent assault vehicles, and many rightly fear these engines of war. Merciless and efficient, a siege robot is as effective at unloading massive damage against a single target as it is at mowing down enemy troops en masse, and its vehicle form makes it difficult to escape from on an open battlefield. Most siege robots are outfitted with large reserves of ammunition, enough to sustain a constant barrage for minutes at a time."
