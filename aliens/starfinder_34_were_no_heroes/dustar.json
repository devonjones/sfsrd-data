To safeguard their businesses, factories, homes, and public buildings, anacites developed the dustar.<br/><br/> These small constructs have domed shells and glide silently across the floor on dozens of tiny legs concealed beneath their carapace. Every day, they go about their work: sweeping floors and walls, sucking up dirt with tiny vacuums mounted on their underside, and disintegrating this debris in a specialized internal chamber. They even polish glass, metal, and other materials with a simple pop-up laser\u2014but every anacite dustar is also a hidden spy and potential assassin. Typically communicating with higher-ranking anacites, such as monitors or ambassadors, the dustar keeps an eye on non-anacite visitors while pretending to be a simple cleaning robot. When intruders threaten to trespass into sensitive areas, the dustar doesn\u2019t issue a warning, which would blow their cover. Instead, they inform other anacites of the danger, coordinate with other dustars within communication range, and lay a trap to exterminate the threat."
