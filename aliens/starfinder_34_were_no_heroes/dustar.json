To safeguard their businesses, factories, homes, and public buildings, anacites developed the dustar.<br/><br/> These small constructs have domed shells and glide silently across the floor on dozens of tiny legs concealed beneath their carapace. Every day, they go about their work: sweeping floors and walls, sucking up dirt with tiny vacuums mounted on their underside, and disintegrating this debris in a specialized internal chamber. They even polish glass, metal, and other materials with a simple pop-up laser\u2014but every anacite dustar is also a hidden spy and potential assassin. Typically communicating with higher-ranking anacites, such as monitors or ambassadors, the dustar keeps an eye on non-anacite visitors while pretending to be a simple cleaning robot. When intruders threaten to trespass into sensitive areas, the dustar doesn\u2019t issue a warning, which would blow their cover. Instead, they inform other anacites of the danger, coordinate with other dustars within communication range, and lay a trap to exterminate the threat."

A race of machines left behind by eons-departed masters, these constructs developed the capacity for evolution and self-improvement, creating an entire mechanical ecosystem.<br/><br/> The most common design for anacites is a basic arthropodan form of silvery metal, with multiple legs for efficient travel and claws or manipulators for accomplishing their assigned tasks. Depending on their role, however, an anacite might be anything from a bulldozer-sized mining specialist to a floating electronic brain designed for advanced problem-solving, and even those anacites who fit the stereotypical metal-insect design usually have a modification or two, and almost all anacites can reconfigure parts of themselves to adapt to their circumstances.<br/><br/> In the uncounted millennia since the departure of the so-called \u201cFirst Ones,\u201d anacites have not been idle. The two primary factions of anacites, Those Who Wait and Those Who Become, have very different ideas of their purpose in life, yet the two are more alike than different. While they variously wait for the First Ones to return or work toward taking on their progenitors\u2019 mantle, anacites endlessly strive to acquire wealth and influence in preparation for their great goal\u2019s fulfillment.<br/><br/> While \u201canacite\u201d officially refers only to the sentient varieties of Aballonian machines\u2014those capable of learning and participating in Aballonian society\u2014many offworlders use it as a catchall term for the world\u2019s mechanical life. Dragonflylike wingbots are an example of Aballonian technobiology. These artificial creatures lack basic sentience yet nevertheless reproduce and fill one of the planet\u2019s ecological niches. These 4-foot-long machines whir from ridge to ridge on wings glittering with solar panels, feeding on the blazing light of the sun. Wingbots can be territorial, and they occasionally attack offworlders or other anacites."
