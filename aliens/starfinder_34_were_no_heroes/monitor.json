            "html": "Monitors are one of the many specialized forms of intelligent anacites. They provide unobtrusive security wherever anacites anticipate physical violence but also desire to avoid an overt display of force. It is not unusual for anacite ambassadors to be assigned a pair of monitors as guards, for example, and anacite facilities with a large number of non-anacite visitors or employees\u2014such as the Horse Eye Orbital Plate\u2014are home to many of these silent, nearly-invisible warriors. A single monitor is often given authority over security in a given facility; there, they maintain shortwave communication with nearby anacites, extending the monitor\u2019s surveillance range and ability to observe threats. If necessary, the monitor can even direct nearby anacites to intercept security threats.<br/><br/> An anacite monitor is mantis-like in shape, with two delicate-looking wings, six long legs, and a distinctive triangular head. Although they have the same unusual eye pattern that all anacites share, the monitor is further equipped with rotating pods on the side of their head, each armed with a deadly electric ray. Despite their large size, they are also surprisingly agile, with two powerful forelegs that end in slashing edges. A monitor\u2019s natural armor is burnished red, but through the use of their chameleon circuits, the anacite monitor can adopt any color or hue, making them surprisingly stealthy."

A race of machines left behind by eons-departed masters, these constructs developed the capacity for evolution and self-improvement, creating an entire mechanical ecosystem.<br/><br/> The most common design for anacites is a basic arthropodan form of silvery metal, with multiple legs for efficient travel and claws or manipulators for accomplishing their assigned tasks. Depending on their role, however, an anacite might be anything from a bulldozer-sized mining specialist to a floating electronic brain designed for advanced problem-solving, and even those anacites who fit the stereotypical metal-insect design usually have a modification or two, and almost all anacites can reconfigure parts of themselves to adapt to their circumstances.<br/><br/> In the uncounted millennia since the departure of the so-called \u201cFirst Ones,\u201d anacites have not been idle. The two primary factions of anacites, Those Who Wait and Those Who Become, have very different ideas of their purpose in life, yet the two are more alike than different. While they variously wait for the First Ones to return or work toward taking on their progenitors\u2019 mantle, anacites endlessly strive to acquire wealth and influence in preparation for their great goal\u2019s fulfillment.<br/><br/> While \u201canacite\u201d officially refers only to the sentient varieties of Aballonian machines\u2014those capable of learning and participating in Aballonian society\u2014many offworlders use it as a catchall term for the world\u2019s mechanical life. Dragonflylike wingbots are an example of Aballonian technobiology. These artificial creatures lack basic sentience yet nevertheless reproduce and fill one of the planet\u2019s ecological niches. These 4-foot-long machines whir from ridge to ridge on wings glittering with solar panels, feeding on the blazing light of the sun. Wingbots can be territorial, and they occasionally attack offworlders or other anacites."
