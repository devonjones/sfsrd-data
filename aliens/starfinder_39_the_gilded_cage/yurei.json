They relentlessly stalk their betrayers, terrorizing them with horrific nightmares before painfully drawing the warmth from their victims with their terribly burnt hands.<br/><br/> A yurei rarely finds peace after taking revenge, often mistaking a different subject as the focus of its wrath. While there are tales of people who calmed a yurei\u2019s rage, too often these creatures can only be put to rest through violence."
