First developed by tattoo artists eager only to improve their art, tattoo guardians were swiftly copied by less scrupulous individuals. As long as the wearer lives, a tattoo guardian can\u2019t be stolen or permanently destroyed. Most tattoo guardians are created in the image of animals, celestials, dragons, fiends, magical beasts, or meaningful symbols, but they use the same statistics regardless of appearance."

It gains the ink interception ability. If a tattoo guardian is ever more than 100 feet from its wearer, it immediately reverts to passive form. A tattoo guardian that is reduced to 0 Hit Points explodes in a 5-ft. radius burst of slippery ink, immediately reverts to passive form, regains 1 Hit Point, and can\u2019t reenter active form for 24 hours. Enemies in the area of the ink explosion must attempt a DC 18 Reflex save or fall prone and become blinded for 1 round.<br/><i>Passive Form:</i> While passive, a tattoo guardian resides on its wearer\u2019s body as a tattoo. It functions as a magic item that cannot be disarmed or sundered. Attempts to identify a tattoo guardian in passive form have a \u201310 circumstance penalty. While the guardian is in passive form, its wearer gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and Will saving throws.
