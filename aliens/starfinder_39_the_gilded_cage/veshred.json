            "html": "Veshreds are voracious, pack-hunting predators adapted to life in the void of space. Found throughout the universe, they\u2019re particularly common in regions where asteroids and planetoids are clustered in close proximity, such as the Diaspora and the rings of Preluria.<br/><br/> Stocky quadrupeds with a hunched body and powerful hind legs, veshreds are adept leapers and climbers. Their eyeless heads are split by a massive mouth lined with rows of serrated teeth that cause terrible wounds. A veshred\u2019s back is covered in tough, overlapping plates that detect, absorb, and metabolize thermal radiation, enabling veshreds to sense heat and consume external energy to sustain themselves without the need for food. When prey is scarce, veshreds raise these plates into a frill that covers much of their body; this greatly extends the distance at which they can detect thermal radiation and enables them to sense prey up to a mile away.<br/><br/> Veshreds are perpetually ravenous, driven by an urge to consume vast quantities of flesh, and they will eat until they become so bloated they can barely move. Veshreds have only one gender and don\u2019t need to mate to reproduce; once sufficiently fed, any veshred can lay a clutch of 3\u20135 large, scaled eggs, which they then cover in a mound of regurgitated food and soon abandon. Upon hatching, the veshred young consume this half-digested food and form a new pack with their clutchmates.<br/><br/> Veshreds hunt and live in packs of three to 12, typically formed by the joining of two to three clutches of juvenile veshreds. Determined and clever, they\u2019re capable of advanced problem-solving and are known to set ambushes, bait larger predators with feigned weakness, and wait out hidden prey for weeks at a time. Rarely, a powerful veshred unites multiple packs into a group called a brood.<br/><br/> A typical veshred stands 3 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds."
