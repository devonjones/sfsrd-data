Though some view the expensive materials required for the robots\u2019 construction as unnecessarily extravagant, devout Kalistocrats believe that the more credits one invests in these robots, the better they perform their duties, and they add their own personal touches to the robots they commission. Luminance-class security robots are intelligent but highly deferential, and the Kalistocracy jealously guards the secrets of their manufacture.<br/><br/> A character trained in Engineering can remove the weapon and components from a destroyed luminance-class security robot with 10 minutes of work. Sometimes the starmetals and gems removed from these robots have substantial resale value."

            "html": "Security robots come in a wide variety of makes and models, with a near-endless variety of customizations based on both the manufacturer and the aesthetics and needs of the consumer. Crafted with advanced user interfaces mimicking moderate intelligence, but without any of the emotions, unpredictability, or bias of a true AI or sentient creature, security bots are an eminently practical, reasonable solution to a wide variety of security needs. Unlike full-on military models, security robots usually come preprogrammed with certain fail-safes preventing them from engaging in violence beyond what\u2019s necessary for the protection of their assigned population or property, making them a go-to option for police forces, corporations, and even wealthy individuals looking for peace of mind.<br/><br/> One of the cheapest and most common types of security robot is the observer. Observer-class bots are usually small, flying robots designed primarily to record and report specific unsavory activities for later review by their owners, though they are also equipped to fend off minor threats. Whether buzzing through the access ducts of secure facilities or hovering over crowded marketplaces, observers are nearly ubiquitous in some advanced settlements. On Absalom Station, the most prominent brand is AbadarCorp\u2019s VizAll, a flying orb with gentle contours designed to put citizens at ease, with a central eye, stubby fins, and relentlessly cheerful speech patterns. Aballon\u2019s Sunward Corporation produces the more disconcerting Arbitron, whose insectile form mimics those of the resident anacites, while Triaxus\u2019s Bluescale Industries crafts theirs to resemble tiny, mechanical drakes. Regardless of their shape, however, observers are known for their convenience, but they are infamous for their limited nuance\u2014a problem for owners who forget their own security passphrase. Some of the cheapest models also have faulty programming that causes them to develop personality quirks, making a particular bot act especially aggressive, friendly, or even dejected.<br/><br/> Patrol-class security robots are more humanoid in shape, standing about 6 feet tall with integrated armaments that keep the robots\u2019 limbs free to apprehend offenders and engage in close combat. Given their deadlier weaponry and tougher armor plating, patrol-class security robots (sometimes simply called \u201cpatrol bots\u201d) are more regulated in their sale and use. They are found mostly in large space stations and corporate facilities under government or syndicate control. As with observer-class robots, these models run the gamut from four-armed Idaran Peacekeepers to the artistic Castrovelian Linewalkers that guard against dangerous jungle beasts, yet the overwhelming industry leader is AbadarCorp\u2019s Town Guard series. With blank, circular faces of glass or glowing energy and cleanly contoured limbs capable of folding up for easy storage, AbadarCorp\u2019s patrol bot is a triumph of industrial design and defense. This model\u2019s reputation has been further boosted due to the fact that it\u2019s the only model of patrol bot currently used by Absalom Station\u2019s government, with many going straight into service from the corporation\u2019s manufactories in the Spike.<br/><br/> Unfortunately, not all security bots end up working for law-abiding corporations or state governments. Various planets in the Pact Worlds system have their own rules about who is or is not licensed to own a security robot, and the Pact Worlds government generally finds it easier to look the other way than to get embroiled in the contentious issues of rights-to- weapons and planetary sovereignty. As a result, it\u2019s not difficult for individuals to purchase security robots entirely unregulated on the black market, albeit at a high cost. In cases where a world outlaws such sales, these models are usually formerly legal models that have been stolen and cracked by hacker gangs, while in other places corporations quietly sell to known criminal enterprises without asking questions. Such security robots are sometimes marked by their owners to show their \u201callegiance\u201d\u2014they might be painted with gang symbols or have their heads replaced with disturbing mannequin busts. Other groups maintain their robots\u2019 official appearances, the better to carry out kidnappings and extortion. Because of this, passersby occasionally stumble across pitched firefights between squads of similar-looking security robots. Those who wish to get involved must be careful to identify each side\u2019s master, as they could find themselves unintentionally taking sides in a gang war.<br/><br/> Though both observer and patrol models have safeguards to protect against it, glitches can occasionally develop in a security robot\u2019s firmware, often the result of massive damage sustained during a firefight or improper diagnostics after such an altercation. In such cases, the glitch can override the bot\u2019s usual baselevel programming regarding tiers of force and the logic of conflict escalation, or even its protocol to protect the innocent. This can result in a bloody rampage, with the robot either going berserk over perceived violation of nonexistent laws, or technically following the law but executing lethal punishment for even the smallest infraction. Even worse, an infected patrol bot\u2019s nanites can carry its corrupted code like a virus, turning other security robots rogue. When this occurs, manufacturers like AbadarCorp are usually quick to hire discreet \u201ccontractors\u201d to deal with the menace (as maintaining their own strike-and-disassembly force would publicly acknowledge the threat)."

Once per day as a reaction, when the robot has its shield aligned against a specific enemy and that enemy targets the robot with a ranged attack that deals energy damage, the robot can reflect that attack back at its source; the attacker rolls the attack normally, but the result is compared to the attacker\u2019s EAC, damaging them on a hit.
