Many believe that the creatures called midships mimics are descended from those creatures, as they can perform similar feats of masquerade. However, a midships mimic can integrate itself into a starship\u2019s system, seamlessly replacing vital components and feeding off the ship\u2019s power. Even when discovered, many crews opt to leave a midships mimic undisturbed, knowing that destroying the creature will leave the system decidedly damaged.<br/><br/> Given enough time however, a midships mimic might reproduce, with offspring consuming more and more of a starship until its most vital systems are more aberration than machine. This leaves the vessel in a precarious situation, for if any of the midships mimics leave or are killed, the ship would become an essentially useless floating wreck."

If the midships mimic is near a functioning part of the starship system (such as a vessel\u2019s engines or power core) that it is mimicking, it can digest and replace the complex machinery over the course of 24 hours. During this time, the system is treated as if it has the glitching critical damage condition, but when the midships mimic is finished, the system functions as normal. Afterward, each time that system gains a critical damage condition, the midships mimic loses 40 Hit Points; removing that critical damage condition fully heals the creature. If an integrated midships mimic is reduced to 0 Hit Points, the system it has replaced immediately gains the wrecked critical damage condition, but can be repaired normally; see the critical damage effect table on page 321 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook for a list of starship systems that can be affected.
