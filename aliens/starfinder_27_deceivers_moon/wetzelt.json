            "html": "Reptoids use their mastery of genetic engineering to create obedient, highly aggressive pets they call wetzelts. The wetzelt is a hunter and tracker, able to swiftly follow prey. The creature also generates an electromagnetic field that jams comm units and causes other powered items to fail on discharge.<br/><br/> Wetzelts are strange in appearance. They possess four appendages like a humanoid, but they crawl on all fours, and their limbs project out from the side. As a result, the wetzelt looks like it is walking on four arms, elbows sticking out. The wetzelt has scaly skin, glowing eyes, and a bulbous head with a beak-like mouth and no visible ears or nose.<br/><br/> The horrifying truth about the wetzelt is that they are not merely organisms grown in a lab. Each was once a reptoid, before being subjected to extensive biological manipulation. Although non-reptoid scholars theorize that this form is a punishment reserved for reptoids who have betrayed their kind\u2014perhaps by revealing reptoid secrets or simply abandoning their assignment to live within their new society, as many reptoids have been known to do\u2014no one in the Pact Worlds knows for sure why some reptoids are transformed. If reversing the transformation is possible, no one has yet discovered a reliable method.<br/><br/> Wetzelts left on their own hunt whatever prey they can find. Their claws are engineered to shred through hard material, so they freely ambush both solitary victims and vehicles with potential prey inside."
