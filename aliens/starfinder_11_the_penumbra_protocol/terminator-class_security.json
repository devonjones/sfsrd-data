Terminator-class security robots are humanoid in appearance, but much larger. They are bipedal and typically stand 8 to 12 feet tall, though some manufacturers are known to create quadrupedal versions of this construct. Most terminator-class security robots have smooth, ovoid heads, with a single camera lens serving as the construct\u2019s visual sensor."

They\u2019re often employed in situations where the risks to living beings are too great or emotional responses are a hindrance\u2014notably murder and war.<br/><br/> Assassin robots are killing machines useful for stealthy slayings or gruesome public displays. A user can program targets into the robot, dispatch the unit, and rest assured. The robot relentlessly pursues its quarry, fearing nothing and using microfiber setae on its hands and feet to traverse vertical and horizontal surfaces with ease. Whether it succeeds, fails, escapes, or suffers destruction, the robot leaves little evidence behind\u2014an assassin robot that is captured or destroyed automatically purges its memory and burns out its sensitive hardware components, making tracing the robot\u2019s mission and origin extremely difficult.<br/><br/> Typical assassin robots are 6 feet tall, weigh 300 pounds, and use the weapons detailed in the stat block on page 108, but they can be outfitted with other armaments as a mission requires. In particular, assassin robots on missions where more subtlety is called for use needler pistols stocked with poisoned darts.<br/><br/> There is nothing subtle, however, about a siege robot. These machines serve as artificially intelligent assault vehicles, and many rightly fear these engines of war. Merciless and efficient, a siege robot is as effective at unloading massive damage against a single target as it is at mowing down enemy troops en masse, and its vehicle form makes it difficult to escape from on an open battlefield. Most siege robots are outfitted with large reserves of ammunition, enough to sustain a constant barrage for minutes at a time."
