A daemon\u2019s favorite method of killing often shapes their form and abilities. Traditional daemons might embrace more conventional means of inflicting death, though newer daemons have adapted to the galaxy\u2019s evolving technology. Both alucidaemons and alorbidaemons prey upon those who lose themselves in digital media. The former drain the life from those who grow obsessed with vidgames. Especially dangerous, alorbidaemons arise from the souls of wicked sensates who perish while engrossed in virtual reality as their bodies withered from neglect.<br/><br/> Alucidaemons take the form of gaunt, child-like figures, their eyes covered by a visor feeding them various realities while they watch in slack-jawed awe. Nearly all of them move with the help of a floating pod that serves as an extension of their bodies; they control its movements with the mechanical gauntlets permanently locked onto their withered hands. Alorbidaemons appear as horrible amalgams of several alucidaemons, joined together in a connected set of pods to form a single body. A typical alucidaemon is 3 to 4 feet tall but weighs 200 pounds due to their mechanical components. A typical alorbidaemon is 4\u20135 feet tall but can weigh 1,000 pounds"

A target subjected to this variation who fails the Will save also attempts a DC 18 Fortitude save; on a success, the daemon must instead teleport it to an unoccupied space. On a failed Fortitude save, the target takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is pinned within the matter. The affected creature isn\u2019t within line of sight of other creatures outside the matter (unless these creatures have a way to see through solid matter) and can\u2019t escape the pinned condition with the usual attack roll or Acrobatics check. However, at the beginning of each turn that it\u2019s pinned within the matter, the target attempts another DC 18 Fortitude save. On a success, it\u2019s teleported to a random unoccupied space adjacent to (or as close as possible to) the solid matter it had been trapped in. On a failure, the target takes an additional 4d10 bludgeoning damage and remains pinned. This is a teleportation effect.",
