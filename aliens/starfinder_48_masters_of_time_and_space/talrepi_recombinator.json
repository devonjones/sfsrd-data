Like their creators, they exist in four dimensions, giving them keen vision and the ability to step through the fourth dimension in a manner similar to teleportation. Resembling the kathrepi in appearance, a talrepi recombinator is a squat robot with nimble digits at the end of two gangly arms and a single domed port in the middle of its head where multiple eye-like openings swim and blink irregularly. Recombinators were created to serve as laboratory assistants and general helpers; to avoid the bother of maintenance, kathrepi gave their recombinators sufficient autonomy to repair and even reconfigure their forms. <br/><br/>The dutiful recombinators quickly understood glimmers of the overarching project that engaged all kathrepi: overcoming entropy. However, without kathrepi intellect, recombinators misunderstood this objective and believed the kathrepi were simply working to bring broken things together\u2014and that mere adhesion would be victory. They reconfigured each other with aggregation beams and adhesive dispensers for this task and were puzzled when their amused creators found little use for these improvements. With the Tesseract all but abandoned, the recombinators often spend their time sticking loose objects to walls or furniture throughout the Tesseract, and they\u2019re often eager to do so with newcomers as well."
