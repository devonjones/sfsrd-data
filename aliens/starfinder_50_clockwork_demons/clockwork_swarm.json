            "html": "Clockwork artificers often test their skills by seeing how small they can make functioning constructs. It takes precision, a steady hand, and years of experience to craft a working clockwork no bigger than an insect. Often these automata are lone curiosities gracing a clockwork engineer\u2019s workshop, but sometimes, an artisan will build hundreds and hundreds of them, linking their programming together to act as a coordinated swarm. These clockwork swarms can prove quite dangerous, usually instructed to do nothing more than to maim and kill.While clockwork swarms are rare presently, a few civilizations tell stories of multiple clockwork swarms capable of razing entire cities as well as repairing their damaged numbers and even constructing new components out of scrap. These tales have yet to be confirmed, though explorers still search for the mythical ruins mentioned.<br/><br/>One edition of the Starfinder Chronicles from over a century ago posits a connection between clockwork swarms, clockwork predators, and several other clockwork constructs that exist. Beyond just their physical appearances and composition, it would seem the clockwork swarms might be a type of builder organism in a larger hierarchy of clockwork creatures. The goals of such constructs remain unknown, and modern clockwork creatures remain mindless, following only pre-programmed routines."

In addition, you can use the environmental grafts found on pages 138\u2013141 of Alien Archive 2 to adapt a clockwork swarm to various types of terrain. For instance, a swarm of clockwork birds has the airborne graft and deals piercing damage with its multitude of beaks. A swarm of clockwork constructs designed to look like tiny salamanders might be able to withstand heat with the desert graft and deals fire and slashing damage with many burning claws."
