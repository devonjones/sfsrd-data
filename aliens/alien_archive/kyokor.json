            "html": "Kyokors are one of the most common types of colossi that rampage like a living apocalypse across the ruined planet Daimalko (see page 464 of the <i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i> for more information). These mammoth, bipedal alien horrors are large enough to take out an entire city block with a few sweeps of their hulking claws, and in fact this seems to be exactly what they evolved\u2014or were designed\u2014to do.<br/><br/>Kyokors are enormous juggernauts covered in shell-like exoskeletons of armored plates, from between which they can extrude hundreds of wriggling tonguelike appendages. They have occasionally been observed using these grotesque tendrils in those rare situations in which they need fine manipulation ability (though they may have others uses as well). Certainly the jagged crablike claws on their arms are useless for grabbing anything smaller than a boulder; these are used almost exclusively to spear and smash. A kyokor has an armored skull with a strangely elongated chin, tiny glowing eyes peeking out from a cavernous gash, and sharp growths like a crown of teeth rising from the top of its head. A single kyokor is typically about 150 feet tall and weighs more than 20,000 tons.<br/><br/> Although most Daimalkans who have ventured to the planet\u2019s surface have seen at least one kyokor from afar, only a handful of the bravest explorers and heroes have ever seen one up close. Most known information about these colossi comes from bloodstained, hastily scrawled records created during the Awakening (the planetwide cataclysm that released the kyokors and other colossi from their slumber deep within the oceans). According to these dossiers, kyokors have the ability to sense large populations of humanoids from incredible distances and to grip their victims\u2019 minds in fear as they gleefully destroy whole cities. The latter ability leaves populations at the mercy of the beasts, and likely contributed to how quickly Daimalko fell into ruins during the Awakening. It\u2019s also said that kyokors are capable of speech, but that no one alive has heard a kyokor\u2019s voice.<br/><br/> Kyokors target population centers, and they seem to equally revel in the fear they produce as they demolish buildings and snatch up tiny humanoid snacks to eat. The monsters are voraciously hungry, but whether it\u2019s destruction or meat that sustains them is unknown. Kyokors exhibit surprising intelligence and are fiercely independent. They occasionally fight other colossi in grudge matches that blast entire landscapes.<br/><br/> Among citizens of the Pact Worlds, rumors swirl about elite bands of Daimalkan colossi hunters who have taken down kyokors and reaped impossible riches from their corpses. Given the creatures\u2019 history, though, the veracity of such claims is question."
