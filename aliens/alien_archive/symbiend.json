Though spread across the galaxy, symbiends share a number of biological similarities that hint at common origins, or at least suggest some measure of engineering in the distant past.<br/><br/> Despite the impressive abilities they grant to hosts, symbiends are almost helpless on their own. They communicate empathically with their hosts, while a rare few are also sentient and able to speak with\u2014and even overwhelm\u2014their hosts. Once a symbiend has been removed from a host, it refuses to rebond to the same host, preferring to find a new creature more invested in the partnership.<br/><br/> Dozens of different symbiends exist, but those most commonly encountered in the Pact Worlds are listed below. The template grafts below can be used to create a creature bonded to a symbiend; at the GM\u2019s discretion, a PC can also bond with a symbiend, ignoring the array requirements and suggested ability score modifiers. A symbiend counts as an augmentation that is \u201cinstalled\u201d in the listed systems, though a removed symbiend can be used by another creature (unlike normal augmentations). Symbiends can\u2019t be purchased or sold (at least, not in reputable settlements)."
