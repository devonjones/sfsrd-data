            "html": "Those who visit the vast forests of Volunisp\u2014a once-uninhabited planet in Near Space close to the Veskarium\u2014often remark on the lack of large-scale predators, when they aren't complaining about the ever-present clouds of small biting insects. Xenobiologists attribute this unusual ecosystem to the presence of what some call \u201cthe apex herbivore of Volunisp,\u201d the strange and unusual kathum. A kathum is an armored quadruped with long ears and well-muscled legs, though they hardly seem necessary as a kathum's unique ability to alter its own gravity allows it to leap from forest floor to canopy in a moment's notice and walk along thin leafy branches as if they were on solid ground. A kathum will use this gift to aggressively make dive-bomb attacks against those who dare to trespass within its wide-reaching territory.<br/> Kathums travel in herds averaging 20 members. Born live, a kathum calf takes 3 weeks to gain enough control over its own gravity to ride safely upon its mother's back. They are particularly vulnerable until then, and older kathums will fiercely protect their newborn young, even chasing perceived threats beyond their usual territorial borders. A typical herd spends 4 hours a day in the treetops feeding, coming down to rest at night. Kathums nest in elevated areas such as large rocks and hills, though never further than 60 feet from the nearest treeline. A typical kathum is approximately 10 feet long and lives for nearly 200 years."
