            "html": "A glaiad belongs to the nymph family: fey with deep intrinsic bonds to a particular feature of nature. Ancient legends told only of dryads, naiads, and similar creatures tied to terrestrial features\u2014but in those days, few knew of the nymphs who forged their bonds not with a single tree or river, but with the glorious ring systems surrounding a distant planet or moon. Like most nymphs, glaiads fiercely protect their bonded ring systems, defending them at all costs. This position has drawn some glaiads into diplomatic contact with other peoples while working to preserve their homes; however, others have become embittered and violent, feeling that\u2019s their only recourse against unbridled disruption of their bonded planets.<br/><br/> Although it might seem difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014for a single creature to look after something that stretches for thousands of miles, a glaiad\u2019s bond with their ring grants them the ability to teleport from one particle in it to another in a matter of seconds, allowing them a wide range of movement."
