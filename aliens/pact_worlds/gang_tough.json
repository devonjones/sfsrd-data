Many just want a quick path to money, no matter who they have to hurt to get it, but others work for gangs to simply keep themselves and their families safe. Regardless of their motives, they usually present themselves as unstoppable and utterly ruthless, fearing that any other type of behavior could be seen as weak. They brag and taunt in combat, hoping to scare foes into surrendering or simply fleeing.<br/> On Akiton, toughs are usually crimson-skinned Akitonian humans (known as the Hylki), androids, or ysoki. In Nightarch on Apostae, they tend to be half-orcs. On Absalom Station, a gang tough is equally likely to be of almost any race. On other planets, a tough is usually one of the dominant race of the world.<br/><b>Adaptation:</b> A gang tough can be a rough-and-tumble street vigilante or hired security at any business on Absalom Station or across the Pact Worlds."

Most claim territories in run-down neighborhoods of big settlements, particularly Absalom Station, Nightarch on Apostae, and the fringes of Verces's Ring of Nations. Akiton faces a particular proliferation of these gangs; there are few ways to make an honest living on this planet, so many of its small mining towns are overrun by criminals. The most successful street gangs often work for far-reaching employers such as the Golden League.<br/> Street gangs usually get involved in all manner of illegal activities: engaging in petty theft, making and selling drugs, fencing stolen goods, and running protection rackets, to name a few. A respectable-looking member of the gang or an individual connected to the gang might operate a front for these criminal enterprises, giving the gang a veneer of legitimacy within the community.<br/> Though they operate on opposite sides of the law, street gangs and security forces are usually found in close proximity. The presence of a street gang in a neighborhood is sometimes answered by an increase in security, but if the street gang is too tough, officers of the law looking after their own safety will refuse to tread on the gang's turf. Alternatively, members of a crooked security force might be working hand-in-hand with a street gang to cover up evidence of crimes in exchange for a handful of credits or other favors. Sometimes an officer of the law works with a criminal organization out of a fear for his life or the lives of his family. In either case, when a street gang is able to set down roots, it can rot the morality of a community from within."
