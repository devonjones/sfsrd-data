To keep themselves in control of this valuable material, they use some of it (as well as purchased parts) to build dangerous drones as well as weapons, armor, traps, and all manner of other devices. These vital skills might lead the machinist to assume leadership of the gang, or they might simply make the machinist a powerful enforcer under a more persuasive and clever gang pusher ringleader.<br/> A chop shop run by one of these machinists is a hotbed of illegal activity, but generally not obviously so from the outside. Anyone who wants to learn what is really going on within should expect stiff resistance in the form of gang toughs, traps, and surprisingly sharp digital security.<br/><b>Adaptation:</b>  A  machinist  can be  an  aspiring  mercenary  not yet distinguished enough to join a respectable company or attract freelance work. A more altruistic machinist could be an agent of the Android Abolitionist Front or an acolyte of Triune."

However, by changing their alignment or circumstances, members of a street gang can also be used as a force fighting for freedom on an oppressed world."

Most claim territories in run-down neighborhoods of big settlements, particularly Absalom Station, Nightarch on Apostae, and the fringes of Verces's Ring of Nations. Akiton faces a particular proliferation of these gangs; there are few ways to make an honest living on this planet, so many of its small mining towns are overrun by criminals. The most successful street gangs often work for far-reaching employers such as the Golden League.<br/> Street gangs usually get involved in all manner of illegal activities: engaging in petty theft, making and selling drugs, fencing stolen goods, and running protection rackets, to name a few. A respectable-looking member of the gang or an individual connected to the gang might operate a front for these criminal enterprises, giving the gang a veneer of legitimacy within the community.<br/> Though they operate on opposite sides of the law, street gangs and security forces are usually found in close proximity. The presence of a street gang in a neighborhood is sometimes answered by an increase in security, but if the street gang is too tough, officers of the law looking after their own safety will refuse to tread on the gang's turf. Alternatively, members of a crooked security force might be working hand-in-hand with a street gang to cover up evidence of crimes in exchange for a handful of credits or other favors. Sometimes an officer of the law works with a criminal organization out of a fear for his life or the lives of his family. In either case, when a street gang is able to set down roots, it can rot the morality of a community from within."
