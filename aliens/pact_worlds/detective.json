The bond between two detectives can grow strong, with the two often eventually thinking as one as they work long hours to crack their cases.<br/><b>Adaptation:</b> Detectives can be an independent private investigators, selling their investigative expertise to any clients who have the money.

The following stat blocks could be used for AbadarCorp corporate security, entrusted with guarding the company's offices and trading outposts. They could also represent the criminal investigation branch of a Hellknight order or even Stewards assigned to a locale to keep the peace. Outside of these specific factions, security force stat blocks could also represent uniformed military police or gendarmerie, shipboard security on a civilian starship, or even religious police dedicated to upholding and enforcing the dogma of a particular faith."

They help keep the peace, maintain order, enforce laws, investigate crimes, and arrest criminals. They might be official police with the full backing of local government, private contractors who hire their services to the highest bidder, or corporate security more concerned with safeguarding company assets than upholding the law. Some security personnel might dedicate their lives to law enforcement and protecting and serving citizens, but others are as corrupt as the criminals they supposedly fight against and can be bought with the right bribes; sometimes both types of security personnel can be found within the same organization, making it difficult to tell who is trustworthy and who is not.<br/> A security force usually has a strict region it patrols, such as a single building, a small town, or a district of a large metropolis. Personnel tend to work with other security forces at the same level\u2014a police officer is expected to coordinate with another officer in a neighboring precinct when the need arises. However, there is often tension over matters of jurisdiction between different security forces when crimes occur in liminal spaces or over multiple regions. An investigator for a national security force searching for a criminal whose infractions threaten the government might butt heads with a corporate complex's head of security if that lawbreaker has holed up in the building's basement. In time, the two generally work out their differences, as they are usually both interested in seeing justice done, but sometimes these squabbles can lead to the criminal's escape."
