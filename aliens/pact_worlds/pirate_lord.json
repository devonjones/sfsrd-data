This political process is fraught with backstabbing and betrayal, as the current members of the Pirate Council are often reluctant to share their power with those whom they consider newcomers.<br/> Each pirate lord commands a fleet of starships and controls one of the innumerable asteroid bases, hidden dockyards, and pirate ports in the Diaspora. A few pirate lords own gaudy mansions on Broken Rock and spend a lot of their time lounging within them, delegating control of their fleets to trusted underlings. Other pirate lords tend to scoff at these hands-off pirate lords.<br/><b>Adaptation:</b> A pirate lord could be a flashy warlord commanding a personal fleet of starships or an organized crime boss. Alternatively, a pirate lord could be a famous pirate hunter, fearlessly tracking down wanted pirates and bringing them to justice."

Adaptation: Not all space pirates are members of the Free Captains, of course, and the following stat blocks and encounters can be used for buccaneers, freebooters, or pirates anywhere in the galaxy. Similarly, these stat blocks can be used to represent any hardscrabble starship crews eking out a living on the fringes of civilized space, whether smugglers, tramp traders, opportunistic scavengers, or even members of organized crime syndicates such as the Golden League. These stat blocks could also represent Starfinder Society members, if played with more interest in knowledge and exploration than raiding and plunder. They might also serve as ragtag military troops, such as a colonial militia or a frontier garrison.<br/>"

More a coalition of independent starship captains than an organized pirate fleet, the Free Captains primarily operate out of the myriad floating asteroids of the Diaspora, but their influence stretches out to the Veskarium, Near Space, and even the Vast. An elected council of pirate lords serves as the organization's ostensible leaders, and any Free Captain \u201cright and true\u201d has the right to vote for council members and to present grievances and other business before the council. However, the Pirate Council's authority over individual Free Captains depends on the strength of the pirate lords' personal influence and the might of their individual pirate fleets. What truly joins the Free Captains together is the pirate code they all share\u2014a loose set of rules that nevertheless provides some structure to the pirates' depredations and serves as a unifying influence when the Free Captains are faced with outside threats from local and interplanetary security forces. Many of the pirate code's \u201crules\u201d leave plenty of room for interpretation, however, and while one Free Captain might set prisoners free once she has relieved her captives of their valuables, another might be a cutthroat buccaneer with no compunction about taking innocent lives.<br/> Piracy in the Pact Worlds is a serious concern for any corporation that needs to ship goods from one planet to another. While the wealthier companies are able to outfit their cargo ships with enough firepower to fend off raiders or hire mercenary escorts, smaller vessels need to be fast or stealthy to avoid the predations of space pirates. Most private citizens rely on Hellknight and Steward patrols to keep space safe, but those forces can't be everywhere at once.<br/>"
