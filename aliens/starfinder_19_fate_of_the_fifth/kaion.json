            "html": "Well-known pests of the seas of Nisis, the River Between, and the Diaspora, kaions float in space and water in search of minerals and flesh. These creatures house chemosynthetic bacteria within their chambered shells, which produce energy from various inorganic minerals the kaion scrapes up with its radula and then excrete metallic impurities as a metabolic byproduct. The alloys accumulate in the kaion\u2019s shell as well as in the numerous metallic sclerites that cover the kaion\u2019s many tentacles and two long arms. Not only do these deposits protect the kaion\u2019s soft tissues, but they also produce powerful magnetic fields that respond to the kaion\u2019s bioelectric impulses, often visible in the expanding and contracting field lines of metallic dust adhering to the creature\u2019s shell.<br/><br/>Though their symbiotes provide much of a kaion\u2019s energy needs, kaions require organic proteins in order to mature and to produce gametes. They obtain this resource from live prey using a characteristic hunting technique. By creating a magnetic gradient down its arms, a kaion can detach and accelerate one of its sclerites to railgun speeds. These projectiles lodge in targets, where they can subsequently be reeled back via magnetic attraction, bringing prey with them. Pods of kaions cooperate to bring down larger prey, with younger kaions firing sclerites and older, higher-status individuals reeling the prey in to feed on.<br/><br/>Though kaions are native to the Diaspora, they have since spread to other worlds as stowaways on ice haulers and other starships. They can now be found grinding away on mines and construction sites from Akiton to Triaxus."
