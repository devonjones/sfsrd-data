Underneath these plates are hollow cavities that a convecyte can use to hide and transport smaller creatures. An acidic fluid runs through its plates, providing a last-minute bit of defense in the event that the convecyte is killed in battle, though it could be considered a liability if the creatures it is protecting aren\u2019t also immune to acid.<br/><br/>The remainder of a convecyte\u2019s body is dedicated to generating enough energy for the creature to be able to heft these plates around and carry passengers. As such, a convecyte needs to consume twice as many calories per day as another creature of its size, making its body warm to the touch and elevating the temperature within its body cavities to nearly 90\u00c2\u00b0 F. The Swarm use convecytes to transport other Swarm creatures into battle, but only on planets where the terrain isn\u2019t too difficult.<br/><br/>A Swarm convecyte is about 12 feet long and stands about 8 feet at its shoulder."

The Swarm moves from planet to planet in tremendous organic hive-ships, reducing each so-called \u201cfeeder world\u201d to a barren husk incapable of supporting life, and occasionally altering its own DNA in the process to take on qualities from that world\u2019s species. Once it has consumed everything of use on a planet, the Swarm moves on, not bothering to hold territory.<br/><br/> Ironically, one of the most violent races in the galaxy also birthed one of the most peaceful, as a mutation within a sub-hive gave life to the shirrens, who broke away to form a new species. The Swarm is notorious not just because of the invasion that finally ended hostilities between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, but also thanks to the warnings of shirrens, who understand the Swarm\u2019s might and its hunger as no other race can.<br/><br/> While individual components of the Swarm have some form of intelligence\u2014or at least a set of complex programmed behaviors that resembles intellect\u2014they cannot generally be reasoned with in any fashion. Swarm components rarely communicate with other creatures, as they see every alien entity as either a food source or a threat. The Swarm\u2019s morale is unbreakable, and while individual components might retreat for tactical reasons, fear is utterly unknown to the Swarm and its components.<br/><br/> The Swarm rarely wields manufactured weapons, instead integrating biotechnology grown or grafted onto component creatures. Because of its constant genetic upgrading and experimentation, the Swarm encompasses components with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and capabilities, from the mighty dreadlancers to the microscopic, bloodstream-infesting toxicytes."
