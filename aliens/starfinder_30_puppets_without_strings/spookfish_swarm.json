Prospectors and outlaws brave enough to travel the ancient seabed of Akiton\u2019s arid Irkonian Sea sometimes come back with a bit of both. They speak of dreamlike beings that haunt the barren gorges and desert flats, apparitions from the bottom of a prehistoric ocean who drift and swim through the air. The most terrifying of these marine phantasms is known simply as the spookfish; though individually tiny, they rise from the sand in bloodthirsty swarms of flashing scales and serrated teeth. Each spectral fish is dotted with false eyespots along its flanks; this defensive camouflage has proven utterly disorienting to those hapless souls caught in a spookfish swarm.<br/> Akitonian archaeologists have unearthed fossils of creatures with a physiology that matches the spookfish, and some speculate that the impact of a meteor evaporated the Irkonian Sea and obliterated the entire species in one fateful instant. Some victims relate a strange curse inflicted by these swarming aquatic ghosts. Innocent travelers report feeling slowly engulfed by steadily rising (though unseen) water\u2014as though an entire spectral ocean was rising up in retribution."
