They come in many varieties, differentiated by culture, species, and planet of origin, but the one described here is the most common variety; known as \u201cmoroi\u201d among their own kind, these creatures are synonymous with the word \u201cvampire\u201d throughout the Pact Worlds, Near Space, and the Vast.<br/><br/> Although a vampire has many well-known weaknesses, most can blend into mortal society and even carry on something like a normal life. They hide in their coffins by day, emerging at night to hunt for food, and are protected by mortal minions who willingly serve in the hope of one day being given immortality\u2014something that they might realize too late is more of a curse than a blessing.<br/><br/> Interstellar travel has enabled vampires to escape those who threaten them, and even avoid some of their most debilitating weaknesses; vampires justly fear the deadly light of the sun, but a vampire who lives on the dark side of Verces never has to worry about the dawn. Vampires have also discovered a new weakness since the Signal: similar to their old inability to cross running water, they can\u2019t willingly enter the Drift unless within the protection of their coffin. Sometimes, a vampire\u2019s coffin takes the shape of an arcane mortuary or cryo-chamber (Starship Operations Manual 24), some of which are equipped with cybernetic systems that enable the vampire to control the surrounding starship from within their coffin. As vampirism has spread to alien species, their association with bats, wolves, and other nocturnal creatures has expanded to include various alien fauna found in systems beyond the Pact Worlds."
