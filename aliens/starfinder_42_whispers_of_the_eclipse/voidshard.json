            "html": "Voidshard vampires result from living creatures unfortunate enough to die either in the presence of sceaduinars (page 55) or in an area otherwise infused with negative energy. Sceaduinars notoriously despise the undead, but they allow voidshard vampires\u2014as forces of entropy and destruction\u2014to continue existing, hoping they destroy other undead in their wake. Voidshard vampires share some of the features of their gargoyle-like creators: hard, rough skin; bat-like ears and wings; and horns. They have their own vampiric traits as well, such as sharp fangs that drain the life from their victims and the ability to create spawn. Despite often being integral to a voidshard vampire\u2019s creation, sceaduinars don\u2019t have control over these undead, though they might torment the newly risen with screeds on the futility of existence. This abuse hardly ever escalates to becoming physical and is usually enough to drive the vampire away to seek out living beings to destroy and feast upon. Sometimes, a voidshard vampire will perpetuate the cycle of abuse by creating spawn of their own, over whom they have complete control. While sceaduinars normally have the ability to hide from undead, this ability doesn\u2019t work on voidshard vampires or their spawn.<br/><br/> Without the support of the creatures who made them, voidshard vampires are left adrift. They tend to flock to remote locations but not completely abandoned ones, such as sparsely inhabited planets, moons, and asteroids. As much as they hate being around the living, they also need to feed on them. Many long to travel to the Negative Energy Plane, clustering around tears in reality or planar portals in the hopes of somehow leaving the Material Plane and escaping their need to feed without giving in to oblivion.<br/><br/> Voidshard vampires scorn the company of both the living and the undead, taking after their sceaduinar progenitors. Voidshard vampires can create voidshard vampire spawn from their victims, and the loneliest do exactly that to create a family of sorts. While voidshard vampires don\u2019t show any kind of affection that the living would recognize, their collectives do live together and fight to protect one another. These collectives are extremely dangerous for any living creature that stumbles upon them. While individual voidshard vampires typically attack and kill their prey without delay, a collective sometimes captures a living creature to ritualistically kill together. Victims killed by collectives in this way nearly always turn into voidshard vampire spawn; the process has an almost religious significance to these vampires, though many would scoff at the insinuation, as they usually consider themselves above such mortal concerns. Rarely does a voidshard vampire become part of any organized church, though those that do often follow Urgathoa.<br/><br/> As creatures touched by entropic forces, voidshard vampires hate order. Whenever they see meticulously organized objects, especially those created from discrete elements, they get a compulsion to destroy them. People who live in places near voidshard vampires (and are aware of their proclivities) often use neatly stacked piles of bricks connected to an alarm as an early warning system against these undead. Certain plants and other living things can incite this hatred of organization within voidshard vampires who harbor the most vitriol in their hearts, and spaces near their lairs tend to be stripped of all life. Technology and other highly ordered objects are an affront to other voidshard vampires, who often take exacting pains to sunder these high-tech items before ferociously descending upon their owners.<br/><br/> On rare occasions, a voidshard vampire rises against the sceaduinar who created them. Such battles usually incur major collateral damage to the terrain and any bystanders. If the voidshard vampire manages to destroy the sceaduinar, the undead absorbs a burst of negative energy from the outsider. Their skin grows completely crystalline, and they develop special powers, such as the ability to blast victims with a spray of cold, incorporeality, and spellcasting. These creatures, known as voidcrystal vampires, are extremely dangerous. Even the spawn of a voidcrystal vampire is about as powerful as a normal voidshard vampire. Some voidcrystal vampires crave the authority of rule, and more than one undead collective in the furthest reaches of the galaxy bend to one of these tyrannical despots."
