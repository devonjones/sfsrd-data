            "html": "Enormous dinosaurs once roamed Weydana\u20134, just as they did on many other planets. However, in the magically isolated Lost Valley, dinosaurs have continued to survive and even thrive. A peculiar species, now known as the weydanasaurus, is unique to this planet. It has a spiny ridge along its back, a plated ridge on its head, and six total limbs, the front four of which can lift off the ground when needed. The dinosaur can eerily extend and undulate the spines along its ridge to frighten possible predators away from its territory.<br/><br/> Weydanasauruses are herbivores that enjoy swimming in shallow pools, and they usually remain in one area for years. If the herd grows beyond 20 or so members, a pair or more weydanasauruses typically set off to start a new herd. They aren\u2019t particularly territorial and don\u2019t typically fight over resources unless food or water is scarce. Given how long they occupy a specific location, weydanasauruses tend to modify their surroundings, pushing rocks into the water to make small pools and piling up soft grasses and leaves for nests, giving weydanasaurus \u201ccamps\u201d a distinctive look.<br/><br/> This particular dinosaur is docile most of the time but becomes exceedingly aggressive during the several weeks when its eggs hatch. Each female weydanasaurus can lay only one or two eggs at most each year; the young are vulnerable for their first few weeks of life and can\u2019t be moved from their nests. To protect the progeny, all adult weydanasauruses in the herd become violently territorial. They use their four front limbs to hold and tear into any creatures that come close to the defenseless young. When hatching season ends, the weydanasauruses return to their normal, laid-back state."
