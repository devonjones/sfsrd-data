One of the nauphage\u2019s two arms ends in a series of thin digits that functions as an organic tool kit, while the other features a vicious claw onto which an organic ranged weapon is grafted. This gun fires an electrically charged adhesive. A translucent membrane on a nauphage\u2019s torso serves as a handy storage sac that the creature can access with ease.<br/><br/> While the Swarm solely uses organic biotechnology, the creatures often have to deal with other species\u2019 technology as they seek to devour those worlds. Nauphages provide the Swarm with technical and logistical support when simply smashing the troublesome tech in question isn\u2019t tactically sound. Adept at hacking and disassembling computers and other equipment, nauphages allow other Swarm components to bypass doors, turrets, and other technological hazards."

The Swarm moves from planet to planet in tremendous organic hive-ships, reducing each so-called \u201cfeeder world\u201d to a barren husk incapable of supporting life, and occasionally altering its own DNA in the process to take on qualities from that world\u2019s species. Once it has consumed everything of use on a planet, the Swarm moves on, not bothering to hold territory.<br/><br/> Ironically, one of the most violent races in the galaxy also birthed one of the most peaceful, as a mutation within a sub-hive gave life to the shirrens, who broke away to form a new species. The Swarm is notorious not just because of the invasion that finally ended hostilities between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, but also thanks to the warnings of shirrens, who understand the Swarm\u2019s might and its hunger as no other race can.<br/><br/> While individual components of the Swarm have some form of intelligence\u2014or at least a set of complex programmed behaviors that resembles intellect\u2014they cannot generally be reasoned with in any fashion. Swarm components rarely communicate with other creatures, as they see every alien entity as either a food source or a threat. The Swarm\u2019s morale is unbreakable, and while individual components might retreat for tactical reasons, fear is utterly unknown to the Swarm and its components.<br/><br/> The Swarm rarely wields manufactured weapons, instead integrating biotechnology grown or grafted onto component creatures. Because of its constant genetic upgrading and experimentation, the Swarm encompasses components with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and capabilities, from the mighty dreadlancers to the microscopic, bloodstream-infesting toxicytes."

(Such awareness can spread along a \u201cchain\u201d of Swarm creatures under appropriate circumstances, potentially alerting distant Swarm creatures).
