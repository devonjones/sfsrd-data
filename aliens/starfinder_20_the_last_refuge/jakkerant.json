            "html": "Jakkerants, also known as javelin squids, are among the most dangerous and feared ambush predators of Utraneus. A jakkerant has an arrowhead-shaped mantle and head. Although its skin is normally a pale brownish color, through manipulation of chromatophores in its skin, a jakkerant can change its skin color. Aggressive jakkerants oscillate coloration in a variety of red or violet hues. Seven eyes ring the base of its head, with tentacles twice the length of its body descending from between each eye. A hard, chitinous material similar in appearance to mother-of-pearl forms a point at the creature\u2019s rear, and smaller spikes run from that tip, down between each eye and along the tentacles, ending in long, pearly spikes. Each tentacle also has a tiny lamprey\u2011like mouth, concealed by the tentacle-spike. These orifices are used to slough meat off a target\u2019s bones and fire lethal jets of acidic water. A typical jakkerant is 3-1/2 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.<br/><br/> Despite their small size, jakkerants are powerful hunters and scavengers. Lone jakkerants are willing to attack creatures much larger than themselves, and groups take on multiple prey at once. Though they prefer moving in the water, jakkerants are able to breathe air and move awkwardly on land by perching themselves upright on several of their tentacles. Like other squid-like creatures, jakkerants have a simple internal chitinous pen or blade that helps the body keep its shape out of the water. Radial parts of this pen form the jakkerant\u2019s mantle spikes.<br/><br/> Jakkerants spend most of their life traveling alone or in pairs known as \u201cflankers.\u201d They occasionally form larger groups to hunt bigger or more numerous prey and to mate. These groups use coloration changes to communicate."
