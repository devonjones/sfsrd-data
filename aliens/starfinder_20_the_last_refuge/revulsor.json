            "html": "Swarm revulsors move in rapid bounds on two abnormally long lower legs. Their upper limbs end in vicious claws, while their small middle limbs are used to carry objects and assist in climbing when necessary. Their thick necks contain powerful vocal cords and highly compressed air sacs. Revulsors can often be found on the front lines of a Swarm advance, pushing back enemies with their ear-splitting shrieks. They also heal quickly and fight savagely until they or their opponents are destroyed. Revulsors almost never withdraw from combat unless compelled by the hive mind, which is very rare.<br/><br/> Revulsors are usually more brightly colored than other Swarm components, as if daring enemies to target them exclusively, which helps stealthier components move to flanking positions. Revulsor carapaces also contain swatches of ultraviolet pigmentation, which some scholars believe were first developed to intimidate a long-lost enemy species that could see such colors. The few revulsors that manage to survive a campaign undergo an organic process that increases the bright and ultraviolet shades on their carapaces. Other, smaller components instinctively defer to such revulsors, who are given honored places at the forefront of the next battle."

The Swarm moves from planet to planet in tremendous organic hive-ships, reducing each so-called \u201cfeeder world\u201d to a barren husk incapable of supporting life, and occasionally altering its own DNA in the process to take on qualities from that world\u2019s species. Once it has consumed everything of use on a planet, the Swarm moves on, not bothering to hold territory.<br/><br/> Ironically, one of the most violent races in the galaxy also birthed one of the most peaceful, as a mutation within a sub-hive gave life to the shirrens, who broke away to form a new species. The Swarm is notorious not just because of the invasion that finally ended hostilities between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, but also thanks to the warnings of shirrens, who understand the Swarm\u2019s might and its hunger as no other race can.<br/><br/> While individual components of the Swarm have some form of intelligence\u2014or at least a set of complex programmed behaviors that resembles intellect\u2014they cannot generally be reasoned with in any fashion. Swarm components rarely communicate with other creatures, as they see every alien entity as either a food source or a threat. The Swarm\u2019s morale is unbreakable, and while individual components might retreat for tactical reasons, fear is utterly unknown to the Swarm and its components.<br/><br/> The Swarm rarely wields manufactured weapons, instead integrating biotechnology grown or grafted onto component creatures. Because of its constant genetic upgrading and experimentation, the Swarm encompasses components with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and capabilities, from the mighty dreadlancers to the microscopic, bloodstream-infesting toxicytes."
