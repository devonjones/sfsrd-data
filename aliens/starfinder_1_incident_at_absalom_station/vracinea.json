            "html": "The vracinea is one such predator, a shambling plant creature with several fanged mouths and large blossoms that both attract living creatures with psychic impulses and exude a scent that holds prey in place. Standing almost 12 feet tall, a typical vracinea weighs 2,000 pounds, though one currently digesting a victim might be heavier.<br/><br/> Usually, a vracinea forsakes its mobility to lie in wait for its next meal, covering its lower half with nearby vines and branches and leaving only its blossom lures visible. If possible, it situates itself in a clearing or at the top of a rise to maximize its hunting range. Once its mesmerized prey has gotten close to it, the vracinea allows its flowers\u2019 paralyzing odor to wash over its victim before the plant creature bursts forth from its camouflage and attacks. If an injured prey manages to shake off the scent\u2019s effects and attempts to escape, the vracinea will pursue as best it can for a short time before giving up and beginning its hunting cycle over again, often selecting a new location in the process.<br/><br/> Xenobotanists aren\u2019t certain of the mechanisms behind a vracinea\u2019s blossom lures, as only a few scientists who set out to study these plant creatures have returned with evidence. Some believe the flowers vibrate at an almost subatomic level, stimulating a target\u2019s subconscious desires, while others think that the vracinea transmits psychic impulses to its prey through the flowers. Either way, affected creatures can\u2019t help but move toward the vracinea until they get caught within the plant\u2019s paralyzing scent aura, after which they are quickly devoured.<br/><br/> Vracineas are solitary and territorial creatures. When two come into contact, they often charge at one another, quickly becoming locked in a struggle of gnashing teeth until one falls dead or retreats to nurse its wounds. The stakes of such skirmishes can be especially high, given that nearby prey are often unable to resist the draw of both creatures and end up standing by, paralyzed. The winning vracinea claims any such prizes and claims the nearby territory. It then picks a new hiding spot and patiently waits for other victims to appear. Rarely, a starving vracinea\u2014easily recognizable by the deep purple coloration of its blossom lures\u2014will pursue, kill, and feast on the loser of a contest of dominance, though this is the only time a vracinea partakes in cannibalism. In fact, a vracinea usually refuses to eat other plant creatures; xenobotanists believe those that do are in fact attempting to reach unabsorbed meat in the other creature\u2019s system.<br/><br/> On Castrovel, vracineas flourish on the continent of Ukulam, where they can stake expansive hunting grounds and avoid other voracious members of their species. All is not completely peaceful, however, as many vracineas compete for food with the jungle\u2019s other carnivorous creatures, such as tentacled ksariks and serpentine mountain eels. Over many generations, ksariks have learned to detect the scent of vracineas from greater and greater distances, along with the knowledge that they have little to gain from ingesting a vracinea\u2019s genetic information. In addition, the two plant creatures tend to be evenly matched, making any confrontation between the two dangerous for both. As a result, they generally only come into direct conflict in times of desperation, or occasionally when a ksarik is tracking victims infected by its carrion spores. Mountain eels, on the other hand, are often more powerful than vracineas, though the two only fight for resources if a vracinea attempts to claim part of a mountainside frequented by a bed of mountain eels for its hunting ground. Usually outnumbered, a vracinea is quickly dispatched by mountain eels, but occasionally one of the plant creatures discovers a nest of newly born elvers left behind by its parents and enjoys a grand feast."
