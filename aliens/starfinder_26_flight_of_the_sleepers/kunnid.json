            "html": "Rarely seen and frequently misunderstood, kunnids are nomadic creatures that wander planetoids across the galaxy in an inexorable journey toward areas where the planetoids\u2019 external magnetic field is strongest. A kunnid has three legs with hooved feet, irregular hornlike growths protruding from its skull, and dozens of prehensile tendrils that dangle from its swollen body. The average kunnid stands 10 to 12 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 1,200 pounds. Many other species on these worlds never glimpse a kunnid in the flesh; frequently, the only evidence of a kunnid\u2019s presence is odd, cloven-hooved tracks marching in straight lines around settlements. Locals frequently attribute these tracks to cryptids and incorporate them into their superstitions.<br/><br/> Many researchers believe that kunnids were created by another intelligent species as living tools for exploration. Others maintain that kunnids belong to an independent lost culture. Some even think that kunnids are the spirits of deceased explorers. With few hard facts about how or why they appear on a world, kunnids\u2019 existence has fueled many conspiracy theories.<br/><br/> When on a planet, kunnids travel relentlessly in straight lines toward magnetic north. They are generally peaceful creatures unless their journey is obstructed or confused by unnatural magnetic fields, at which point they lash out. Once at a world\u2019s magnetic north pole, kunnids establish lairs and mate. However, this never seems to result in an increase in kunnid populations, as groups of kunnids often mysteriously disappear overnight."
