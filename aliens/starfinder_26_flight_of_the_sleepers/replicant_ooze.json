            "html": "Grays bioengineered the first replicant oozes during their first attempts to create full clones. While the grays found that the protoplasm could be shaped into the forms of sapient creatures through liberal use of electric shocks, the resultant shape was essentially still an ooze, requiring actual brains to be able to function. Once the grays incorporated brains into the protoplasm, they realized that the altered oozes took on the personality and memories of the \u201cdonors.\" Grays then began to use these oozes as quick, albeit messy, ways to replace subjects who accidentally perished from too-rigorous experimentation.<br/><br/> A replicant ooze requires a fresh brain (or similar organ) to be able to believably impersonate a victim, usually requiring the ooze to consume the corpse within minutes after it has died. When a replicant ooze duplicates a person, it often doesn\u2019t realize it is an impostor and attempts to live out the victim\u2019s daily life. After a while, though, the victim\u2019s friends and family begin to suspect that something is wrong, as the replicant ooze is usually less intelligent and socially adept than the original.<br/><br/> Though replicant oozes are eventually found out if left out in the field for too long, gray agents use them as stopgap measures. Eventually, grays usually abduct the replicant ooze and replace it with a true clone, using memory extraction and implantation technology to copy any memories the replicant ooze might have formed into the clone\u2019s brain."

After this time, the replicant ooze looks like an exact duplicate of the dead creature, though without any major visible trauma, and compressing any excess ooze material within itself. While in this form, the replicant ooze loses the blindsense, mindless, and sightless abilities and gains the consumed creature\u2019s size, reach, natural attacks, non-magical move speeds, languages (as well as ability to speak all languages it knows), and memories, as well as an Intelligence modifier equal to that of the creature consumed minus 1. Also, the replicant ooze has the skills the creature had in life, using the creature\u2019s total skill bonus with a \u20135 penalty. This ability otherwise functions as change shape. When a replicant ooze loses more than half of its total Hit Points, it immediately reverts back to its Large ooze form.
