            "html": "Among the innumerable components found within the Swarm, escutchides are rarely seen by members of other species, as they are almost never deployed as part of the Swarm\u2019s invasion forces. The primary function of Swarm escutchides is to protect locations where the Swarm has established a persistent presence, such as Swarm nesting sites, segments of the Swarm undergoing transitions or repairs, or large-scale construction and mining efforts. When partnered with other components, escutchides take up defensive positions and do their best to stop encroaching enemies, leaving the other Swarm components free to complete their tasks or attack with ranged weapons.<br/><br/> Swarm escutchides are broad, sturdy creatures, and individuals stand about 8 feet high and weigh half a ton. An escutchide\u2019s most distinctive feature is the large horn protruding from its head, often as long as half the creature\u2019s overall length. It uses this prominent horn to run through and knock down foes. Thanks to sets of large wings, escutchides are also surprisingly capable fliers, and more than one invading enemy has met a nightmarish end when a pack of Swarm escutchides dropped down upon them from above."

            "html": "Originally an insectile race called the kucharn, the Swarm is now a single-minded collective with a desire to consume all things and absorb their best qualities into itself. The Swarm moves from planet to planet in tremendous organic hive-ships, reducing each so-called \u201cfeeder world\u201d to a barren husk incapable of supporting life, and occasionally altering its own DNA in the process to take on qualities from that world\u2019s species. Once it has consumed everything of use on a planet, the Swarm moves on, not bothering to hold territory.<br/><br/> Ironically, one of the most violent races in the galaxy also birthed one of the most peaceful, as a mutation within a sub-hive gave life to the shirrens, who broke away to form a new species. The Swarm is notorious not just because of the invasion that finally ended hostilities between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, but also thanks to the warnings of shirrens, who understand the Swarm\u2019s might and its hunger as no other race can.<br/><br/> While individual components of the Swarm have some form of intelligence\u2014or at least a set of complex programmed behaviors that resembles intellect\u2014they cannot generally be reasoned with in any fashion. Swarm components rarely communicate with other creatures, as they see every alien entity as either a food source or a threat. The Swarm\u2019s morale is unbreakable, and while individual components might retreat for tactical reasons, fear is utterly unknown to the Swarm and its components.<br/><br/> The Swarm rarely wields manufactured weapons, instead integrating biotechnology grown or grafted onto component creatures. Because of its constant genetic upgrading and experimentation, the Swarm encompasses components with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and capabilities, from the mighty dreadlancers to the microscopic, bloodstream-infesting toxicytes."
