            "html": "Evolving from colonies of bacteria native to undersea volcanic vents, thermophilic oozes are adapted to some of nature\u2019s harshest and most inhospitable environments. On worlds with low amounts of tectonic movement and consistent volcanic activity, such bacteria can grow over the course of millennia, joining together into larger and larger forms. Eventually, these creatures gain enough cohesion to leave their fiery, corrosive homes, driven by a hunger for organic prey. With their amorphous bodies and immunity to fire and acid, thermophilic oozes have almost limitless access to places other creatures dare not tread, giving them zones of safety from which they can hunt. Thermophilic oozes can consume and gain sustenance from any organic matter, but many of them seem to prefer to chase down living creatures over immobile plants.<br/><br/> In addition to providing a safe haven, a thermophilic ooze\u2019s warm and corrosive home environments are necessary to the creature\u2019s long-term survival. When deprived of the acidity and heat of their homes for an extended period of time, the creatures need to eat more and more with each passing day. This makes them more aggressive when encountered outside of their native environments\u2014such as those that hitch an unintended ride on an excavator or deep-sea submarine.<br/><br/> Thermophilic oozes are a particular nuisance near the planet Ilemchuuva\u2019s underwater volcanic vents and mining sites. Local bolidas take great pleasure in exterminating them en masse, considering them to be a form of dangerous vermin. Bolida miners pass around stories of thermophilic ooze infestations left unchecked, leading to the loss of valuable equipment and, far more importantly, fellow workers. When outside of its preferred environment, a thermophilic ooze tends to take the shape of a flattened sphere roughly 3 feet across, though it can squeeze itself through quite small openings given enough time. A thermophilic ooze weighs approximately 300 pounds."
