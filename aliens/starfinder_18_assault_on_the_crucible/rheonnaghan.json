            "html": "Many scholars believe that the heart of every star contains a link to the Positive Energy Plane. Though this theory is difficult to verify, temporary portals to the Positive Energy Plane have been recorded deep within the Pact Worlds\u2019 sun, as well as the suns of other advanced civilizations. Rarely, a crystalline mass that precipitated from the surrounding plasma coalesces around such a rift, similar to the way an oyster forms a pearl. The abundant energy radiating from the Positive Energy Plane sometimes infuses this matter with life and ejects it from the star, giving birth to an enigmatic native outsider known as a rheonnaghan.<br/><br/> Appearing as pulsing geometric shapes of pure energy, rheonnaghans have an almost unshakable fascination with the suns of the galaxy. Though they aren\u2019t immune to the heat and radiation produced by stars, they tend to hover in close proximity to them in order to study their cosmic phenomena, and are sometimes mistaken for mystical pieces of solar ejecta. Most rheonnaghans naturally develop solarian-like powers, and some retain the crystalline cocoons from which they were born, using them to conduct experiments into their own nature.<br/><br/>Though rheonnaghans are rare, the planar scientists who study them agree that no two are alike\u2014each exhibits their own unique geometric form. No one has yet discerned the meaning of the differences in rheonnaghan\u2019s shapes, though many theories have been posited, ranging from age to a representation of the galactic coordinates of the sun from which the outsider was born. When asked about it, rheonnaghans don\u2019t seem to understand the question and become offended at their existence being reduced to simple mathematics.<br/><br/>A typical rheonnaghan stretches approximately 20 feet across but weighs next to nothing."
