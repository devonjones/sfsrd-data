            "html": "Incapacitator robots are built to restrain and subdue, so they are popular among bounty hunters who want to bring quarry back alive and also among security forces with safety concerns. Their large, padded fists strike hard but focus on getting a subduing hold on targets and are designed to deal no lasting damage. When forced to deal with targets at a distance, the robots hurl stickybomb grenades to slow down their marks while closing to melee range. Barring that, integrated shock pistols allow the robots to use jolts of electricity that cause muscles to seize up. Specialized programming allows the robots to strike at a hampered target\u2019s weak points.<br/><br/> Most models of incapacitator robot are shaped like hemispheres balanced on four articulated legs. Two to three arms used for striking and grabbing jut from the hemisphere\u2019s top surface, along with an integrated weapon on a rotating turret. A single sensor bar runs the entire circumference of the robot\u2019s body and can see in every direction at once. These models stand about 5 feet tall, 5 feet long, and 5 feet wide. They can weigh up to 1 ton.<br/><br/> Some manufacturers build incapacitator robots, especially those used in public sectors, to have a more humanoid appearance. These may have friendly faces and a layer of soft, cushioning material enclosing the robot\u2019s frame. Sometimes colloquially referred to as \u201chugbots,\u201d these models can envelop their targets in a crushing embrace that can squeeze the breath (and consciousness) out of almost any living creature. The typical \u201chugbot\u201d is about 7 feet tall and weighs 750 pounds."

They\u2019re often employed in situations where the risks to living beings are too great or emotional responses are a hindrance\u2014notably murder and war.<br/><br/> Assassin robots are killing machines useful for stealthy slayings or gruesome public displays. A user can program targets into the robot, dispatch the unit, and rest assured. The robot relentlessly pursues its quarry, fearing nothing and using microfiber setae on its hands and feet to traverse vertical and horizontal surfaces with ease. Whether it succeeds, fails, escapes, or suffers destruction, the robot leaves little evidence behind\u2014an assassin robot that is captured or destroyed automatically purges its memory and burns out its sensitive hardware components, making tracing the robot\u2019s mission and origin extremely difficult.<br/><br/> Typical assassin robots are 6 feet tall, weigh 300 pounds, and use the weapons detailed in the stat block on page 108, but they can be outfitted with other armaments as a mission requires. In particular, assassin robots on missions where more subtlety is called for use needler pistols stocked with poisoned darts.<br/><br/> There is nothing subtle, however, about a siege robot. These machines serve as artificially intelligent assault vehicles, and many rightly fear these engines of war. Merciless and efficient, a siege robot is as effective at unloading massive damage against a single target as it is at mowing down enemy troops en masse, and its vehicle form makes it difficult to escape from on an open battlefield. Most siege robots are outfitted with large reserves of ammunition, enough to sustain a constant barrage for minutes at a time."
