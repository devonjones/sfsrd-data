            "html": "While sapient creatures throughout the galaxy consider most oozes to simply be disgusting monstrosities, the tiny proog is relatively harmless\u2014at its worst a minor pest, and at times a pleasant companion or pet. According to records (or more precisely, the lack of records) proogs were first discovered, or possibly created, during the Gap. Today, they are known mostly as novelty companions, due to their diminutive size, gentle attitude, and ability to transform into small objects. Proogs can mimic objects with exact precision even though they have no eyes or other visual sensors, although scientists are still uncertain on how the oozes do so. Some believe proogs have psychic abilities, but others insist proogs are able to quickly analyze objects on a molecular level before adopting the new shape.<br/><br/> Regardless of the facts of a proog\u2019s biology, retailers are happy to sell them as pets, and a proog is perfectly content to be toted around in a small bag and fed the occasional table scrap. Proog companions are surprisingly affectionate toward their masters and are easy to train, able to perform simple transformation tricks during which they adopt the shape of various small objects as instructed by their owners. Proogs are especially popular with small children, who delight in sliding the oozes through their fingers and watching them change colors. The only downside of keeping a proog companion is the nuisance that comes with trying to find a proog after it has misbehaved. Those shopping for a proog pet should be wary, however, as unscrupulous retailers have been caught selling imitation proogs, which the merchant insists are merely sleeping or lethargic but then are later discovered to be molded gelatin in the shape of a common household object.<br/><br/> As is often the case with small designer pets, many proogs have escaped their owners over the years only to reproduce in the wild. Untamed proogs can be found in a variety of environments, and though they are relatively harmless, they sometimes lash out in fear. A wild proog will transform into a small object, such as a coffee mug, and hide in plain sight. There it will remain for hours at a time, only moving to feed off discarded garbage when it is alone and unobserved. However, a proog\u2019s ability to mimic is not perfect, and their telltale sheen sometimes gives them away. Wild proogs are often discovered when they are accidentally dropped and, instead of shattering, the injured ooze scurries away to hide."
