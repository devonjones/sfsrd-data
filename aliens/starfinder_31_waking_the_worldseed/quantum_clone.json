            "html": "Quantum clones are near-exact copies of living beings, usually created by accident through the misuse of quantum technology, though some powerful technomancers have claimed they\u2019ve duplicated the process through magic. Since quantum clones are very rare, they have yet to be studied in detail. Some physicists believe they are composed of microscopic virtual particles formed by the fluctuation of spacetime (called \u201cquantum foam\u201d) writ large. Others believe quantum clones were ripped from an alternate dimension.<br/><br/> Whatever the case, a creature\u2019s quantum clone has the exact appearance, personality, and memories of the original creature at the time of its cloning. A quantum clone isn\u2019t inherently evil, nor do they necessarily wish others harm. However, they initially believe themself the being they were cloned from, which occasionally results in altercations. When faced with their double, the quantum clone quickly realizes they\u2019re an unstable copy. While this revelation sometimes leads to great emotional distress, most quantum clones attempt to forge new lives far away from those who might recognize them."
