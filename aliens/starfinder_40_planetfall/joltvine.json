            "html": "Across Weydana-4, white trumpet vines are fast-growing creeping vines that have overrun several temperate regions. Brought in as decorative plants by settlers from the Marixah Republic who didn\u2019t realize how seriously they would impact the local ecosystem, white trumpet vines have outlived their humanoid tenders and spread rampantly for over a century. They smother native plants. Their distinctive white trumpet-shaped flowers draw pollinators, and their broad leaves shade other plants from vital sunlight.<br/> However, powerful lightning storms can funnel an overwhelming amount of electricity into a white trumpet vine (such as from a bolt of lightning), and the plant\u2019s cells become infused with the energy, transforming the mundane vines into the much more dangerous joltvines. Joltvines gain a modicum of sentience from the transformation.<br/> Joltvines uproot themselves from the white trumpet vines clustered around them and, by means of electrical transmission in their cells, writhe slowly but determinedly along surfaces, following a rudimentary instinct to seek out other sources of electricity. When a joltvine detects faint electric signals in living beings\u2014or powerful electric signals in technological equipment\u2014it attacks the source with its own darts of electricity. If it suspects prey might happen by, it prepares and ambush by hiding among mundane vegetation by closing up its distinctive white flowers.<br/> New joltvines seek to spread their genetic material; fortunately, joltvines produce only more white trumpet vines, not more joltvines. Joltvines thus tend to be solitary creatures once they\u2019ve left the patch where they were created."
