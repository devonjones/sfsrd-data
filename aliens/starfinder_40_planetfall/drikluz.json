            "html": "Not all gremlins are intimately tied to technology; some represent older troubles that have plagued civilization for eons. One unpleasant example is the drikluz, or vermin gremlin. No more than 2-1/2 feet tall (and nearly as wide), drikluzes boast round, furry bodies teeming with lice, biting flies, and other loathsome insects. A drikluz has a helmetlike carapace over its forehead and crown, which protects its insectile face and two antenna. The drikluzes' antennae focus the gremlins\u2019 latent psychic powers into a constant, crooning telepathic drone that soothes nearby insects into a complacent state and attracts them to their round, hairy bodies. They then bully and cajole their mindless minions into causing as much trouble as possible, including sabotaging insect traps and spoiling or hiding pesticides. Drikluzes have been noted to exhibit some limited ability to twist the minds of larger creatures as well, but they rarely do so for any purpose other than compelling such creatures to leave them alone.<br/><br/> While a creature that lures vermin away may seem a fine service in theory, the presence of drikluzes in a community is far from beneficial, as these gremlins are mean-spirited and rarely content to simply lead vermin away. They love seeing insects spoil crops, terrorize pets, and infest bedding."
