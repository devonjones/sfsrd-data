However, most scholars agree that the length of spiked chain that runs along a vespers hound\u2019s back and seems to serve as its spine is definitely a velstrac addition. Those who witness a vespers hound extending that chain to envelop a nearby victim (and survive to tell the tale) are doubly certain about this theory.<br/><br/> Instinctively able to sniff out places where corruption and suffering have taken root, vespers hounds are sometimes used by velstracs as tracking beasts and faithful pets. Their presence seems to exacerbate dormant shadow corruption festering within mortals, and though vespers hounds don\u2019t need to eat, they seem to enjoy tearing into such mortals\u2019 flesh. A vespers hound is approximately 5 feet long, stands about 3 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 140 pounds."
