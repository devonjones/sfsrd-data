A planetwide disaster millions of years ago split the common ancestor of both species into two populations. One population remained on the planet\u2019s devastated surface and evolved into the skittermanders. The other population retreated into the planet\u2019s extensive cave system, becoming larger, faster, and increasingly vicious as they competed for dwindling food supplies. Eventually, the stridermanders reemerged on the surface and the two populations met once again\u2014and the skittermanders became prey.<br/><br/> Called strovion by the vesk, which roughly translates as \u201cskittering wolves,\u201d stridermanders are brawny and threatening. Like most natives of Vesk-3, they have eight limbs, four of which are long and graceful, capable of running at high speeds and climbing through the rocky caverns where the creatures make their nests. The four shorter arms are more muscular and used for restraining prey, mating, and manipulating their environment. Their most identifiable feature is a feeding tendril that emerges from their abdomen\u2014 similar to that of a skittermander whelp\u2014which is long enough and strong enough to drag a grown human through the darkness or lift a vesk soldier into the air.<br/><br/> Stridermanders feed by restraining their victims and puncturing their flesh, draining their fluids first so the rest of the body can be eaten more slowly over time. They prefer preying on skittermanders but will attack and devour anything their own size or smaller, as the vesk have discovered.<br/><br/> While simpleminded and animalistic, stridermanders are clever predators and construct simple obsidian tools. They have no language but hunt using coordinated pack tactics. Even more terrifying, skittermander legends speak of stridermander tyrants\u2014larger, more vicious mutants with uncanny abilities to cloud people\u2019s minds and fool the senses.<br/><br/> Today, stridermanders remain a danger in Vesk-3\u2019s deep forests and caverns, though the Veskarium has heavily curtailed their numbers. Their whelps are small, rodent-like, and solitary, making them difficult to exterminate and allowing them to easily stow away on starships. Stridermanders have consequently migrated to several other worlds, where they reproduce quickly and fill apex predator roles in wilderness and ruins environments. Vesk see the species as dangerous predators worthy of hunting, and the Veskarium has exported stridermanders off-world for use as guard beasts, and for a variety of dangerous sporting events."
