            "html": "The field of quantum mechanics attempts to describe the interactions between subatomic particles. By analyzing the angular momentum and energy stored within subatomic particles, scientists hope to be able to better understand the fundamentals of the universe, but these studies are often complicated by the unusual nature of many of such particles. Researchers who experiment too recklessly with quantum forces run the risk of spontaneously creating a quantum slime, an incredibly dangerous ooze composed of enlarged subatomic particles floating inside a mass of cloudy protoplasm-like goo. Though mindless, a quantum slime has the ability to alter reality at a quantum level, calling forth storms of cosmic energy, teleporting itself and others, or diminishing a creature\u2019s overall competency. A quantum slime floats from place to place in a rough disc shape, occasionally extending a 10-foot-long tendril wreathed in plasma energy to strike at foes.<br/><br/> When a quantum slime is created, usually by accident inside a laboratory or other research facility, it immediately lashes out against all other creatures present with a single-minded fury. Once it has destroyed everyone around it, the quantum slime begins exploring in response to some unknown stimulus. A quantum slime seems to move at random, occasionally teleporting past obstacles and then crossing back over its own path and attacking anything that stands in its way. Some scientists posit that quantum slimes move in response to changes in the environment on a subatomic level. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to replicate the conditions that create a quantum slime and even harder to capture and study one. A few researchers have had some luck directing a loose quantum slime\u2019s movement by generating low-level electrical charges near the slime; too much charge, though, causes the slime to attack the source of the energy.<br/><br/> A quantum slime can create a quantum-entangled copy of itself, an ability that both fascinates scientists and makes the creature extraordinarily difficult to battle and contain. This allows the slime to be in two places at once, though both versions are connected to one another\u2014when one takes damage, the wounds appear on both. As a defense tactic, the quantum slime can cause one of its copies to disappear instead of taking damage. This raises many questions about which quantum slime was the original version and which was the duplicate\u2014a metaphysical conundrum that most quantum physicists answer with a shrug and a platitude about the \u201cmysteries of the subatomic universe.\u201d<br/><br/> Thus far, modern science has encountered only quantum slimes that were created accidentally and artificially within laboratory settings; no one has ever observed a naturally occurring quantum slimes. As a result, no concrete details about the quantum slime\u2019s ecological niche, life cycle, reproduction, diet, and behavior are known."

The copy is identical to the original slime, including any ongoing bonuses, penalties, or effects with the same remaining duration, and the two slimes share a single pool of Hit Points, uses of spell-like abilities per day, and initiative count. The two slimes count as a single creature for the number of actions they can perform each round, and share the total number of actions between themselves (for instance, one slime can take a move action to move while the other slime takes a standard action to attack); if the slimes take a full action to make a full attack, each slime can attack once with the standard \u20134 penalty. If a foe attempts to cast a spell that affects both slimes, it must attempt to overcome the spell resistance of each slime, as if the slimes were two different creatures; if the foe fails to overcome the spell resistance of one of the slimes, neither is affected by the spell. If the two slimes are caught in an area effect that doesn\u2019t allow for spell resistance, each one attempts a saving throw (if allowed), and the two slimes use the result of the highest saving throw, though if the spell deals damage, the slimes take damage only once. Any condition successfully imposed on one slime or action taken by one slime to affect itself (such as fighting defensively) affects both copies. When one slime is about to take damage, the quantum slime can \u201cdismiss\u201d that copy as a reaction; this negates the damage and causes the attack (if any) to miss. The remaining quantum slime becomes the \u201ctrue\u201d version of the creature. The two copies must remain within 200 feet of one another; if they are moved farther apart than that, one random copy of the slime is dismissed as above.
