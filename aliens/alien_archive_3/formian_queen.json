            "html": "The queen is the center of a formian hive, figuratively and literally. A queen\u2019s physical existence is rooted in reproduction: her first responsibility is laying the eggs that populate the hive. Indeed, she can\u2019t actually stop this process, which takes place largely without conscious thought as she goes about her business. In emergencies, some queens resort to extreme hormonal treatments to suppress their laying, but such drastic means are rarely employed. Once they start laying, most queens never physically move more than a few feet at a time; in the rare event that they must be relocated, they are carried upon massive palanquins by members of the hive or are installed on hovering thrones.<br/><br/> These physical constraints don\u2019t mean a queen is helpless or powerless. A queen has defensive capabilities unparalleled in the hive, including the ability to teleport herself away from danger if overwhelmed. She can turn her telepathic prowess into a weapon to harm and disable foes, and she can possess any member of the hive to borrow their senses and inspect locations, interact with others, or confront intruders \u201cin person.\u201d<br/><br/> Each formian hive\u2014typically an entire settlement\u2014has its own queen, and the hive is absolutely subordinate to the queen, epitomizing the ultimate order and hierarchical nature of formian society. In the distant past, this loyalty led to tremendous conflict between hives, as each queen and hive pursued its own agenda and perceived the others as threats. The long-ago establishment of the abstract concept of the \u201cOverqueen\u201d among the formian queens of Castrovel enabled separate hives to unify their goals and operations, effectively creating one metahive among all of formian society on that planet. The directives established by the Overqueen are purposefully broad suggestions promoting the well-being of the formian race, so as to avoid infighting between queens trying to set more specific goals.<br/><br/> Within a hive, the queen is the absolute authority: she establishes the overall direction and goals for the hive, which the various hive members\u2014from the powerful myrmarchs down to the countless workers\u2014strive to carry out. Part of this comes from the fact that the vast majority of a hive\u2019s members are direct offspring of the queen (in fact, when a new queen takes over, a hive sees massive turnover as its members are rapidly replaced with the new queen\u2019s brood); as with most social insects, the genetic similarity of a single queen\u2019s offspring leads to tight social bonds and minimal competition. The queen is typically quite active in the hive\u2019s operations, meeting with myrmarchs and taskmasters personally to provide specific and detailed instruction."
