            "html": "There is a seemingly infinite variety of Swarm components, as the species adapts and creates specialized spawn to counter the many obstacles it faces in its effort to devour the galaxy.<br/><br/> A Swarm dissolver\u2019s main focus is to protect smaller Swarm components and provide an impenetrable front line during combat, incinerating the most formidable foes while also accompanying corrovoxes, mindreapers, and other Swarm shock troops when they swoop in to clean up after a battle. A dissolver\u2019s exoskeleton is thicker than that of most other Swarm creatures, but its most prominent offensive feature\u2014sturdy horns that curl back toward the dissolver\u2019s body\u2014 are surprisingly not its primary weapons; these horns instead function as a last-resort defense, allowing a dissolver to fling enemies away with a mighty shove. A dissolver\u2019s main mode of attack is actually hidden between its mandibles: two vascular conduits pump highly corrosive and combustible chemicals from within separate glands in the dissolver\u2019s abdomen. These chemicals are inert when separate but explode when combined, in a conflagration of acid and fire. Like many other Swarm components, a dissolver bears a set of insectile wings, but they aren\u2019t powerful enough for the massive, heavy creature to fly.<br/><br/> Swarm xersks are a rare sight, and in fact only a handful have been seen by members of other species who lived to spread news of their existence. These creatures rarely resort to physical attacks, instead relying on their potent psychic abilities to mentally assault and frighten intelligent creatures.<br/><br/> These bizarre Swarm components have large, crested heads covered in a horrifying array of staring eyes. Those who look into a xersk\u2019s eyes for even a few seconds begin to question reality, and may eventually lose their hold on it altogether.<br/><br/> Superficially, xersks appear to exhibit more free will than most Swarm components. They can often be found alone, quietly observing a geographical feature or distant constellation. Despite this odd behavior, xersks are still very much a part of the Swarm\u2019s hive mind, and like every Swarm component, they act solely to further the Swarm\u2019s machinations, no matter how nebulous their demeanor might seem to outside observers."

The Swarm moves from planet to planet in tremendous organic hive-ships, reducing each so-called \u201cfeeder world\u201d to a barren husk incapable of supporting life, and occasionally altering its own DNA in the process to take on qualities from that world\u2019s species. Once it has consumed everything of use on a planet, the Swarm moves on, not bothering to hold territory.<br/><br/> Ironically, one of the most violent races in the galaxy also birthed one of the most peaceful, as a mutation within a sub-hive gave life to the shirrens, who broke away to form a new species. The Swarm is notorious not just because of the invasion that finally ended hostilities between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, but also thanks to the warnings of shirrens, who understand the Swarm\u2019s might and its hunger as no other race can.<br/><br/> While individual components of the Swarm have some form of intelligence\u2014or at least a set of complex programmed behaviors that resembles intellect\u2014they cannot generally be reasoned with in any fashion. Swarm components rarely communicate with other creatures, as they see every alien entity as either a food source or a threat. The Swarm\u2019s morale is unbreakable, and while individual components might retreat for tactical reasons, fear is utterly unknown to the Swarm and its components.<br/><br/> The Swarm rarely wields manufactured weapons, instead integrating biotechnology grown or grafted onto component creatures. Because of its constant genetic upgrading and experimentation, the Swarm encompasses components with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and capabilities, from the mighty dreadlancers to the microscopic, bloodstream-infesting toxicytes."

A target creature must succeed at a DC 24 Will saving throw or the Swarm xersk latches onto it mentally and begins siphoning the victim\u2019s fear; if the creature gained the condition from one of the Swarm xersk\u2019s spells or abilities, it takes an additional \u20132 penalty to this save. At the beginning of an affected target\u2019s turn, it takes 2d6 damage, and the Swarm xersk regains Hit Points equal to half that amount (minimum 1). A Swarm xersk can be simultaneously attached to a number of victims equal to half its Wisdom modifier (5 for most Swarm xersks). An affected creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to break the psychic connection and end the ability\u2019s effects. The effects of siphon fear end automatically if an attached creature\u2019s condition is removed. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
