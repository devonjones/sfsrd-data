            "html": "While it is unknown exactly what happens to any starfarer unfortunate enough to be pulled into a black hole, most scientists are certain that nothing can survive the multitude of gravitational forces that batter anything that passes the event horizon. However, reports of strange undead creatures appearing on starships and space stations near these deadly cosmic phenomena have led kasatha mystics aboard the Idari to conjecture that the terrible agony undergone by those consumed by a black hole sometimes allows their spirits to escape the phenomenon and continue on to wreak havoc among the living. The kasathas call such entities vorthuuls, though they are sometimes referred to as singularity wraiths by others. A vorthuul is a strange apparition that appears to be composed of two intertwined forms: one a squat, obsidian skeleton that emanates calm, the other the phantom visage of a creature eternally screaming in unbearable pain as it is stretched to impossible lengths. Neither of these forms ever separates from the other, though one spirit always seems to have dominance at any given moment, pulling along the other with its whims.<br/><br/> Kasatha sages suggest that these two entangled spirits were once a single living creature that suffered the extreme misfortune of being pulled inexorably into the mouth of a black hole. In this moment, where time and reality get twisted, the black hole creates two versions of the same creature: one that is tortuously extended vertically while being compressed horizontally, and the other that is crushed into infinite density as it is drawn into the singularity. Both versions of the original creature are horribly killed, of course, and their spirits are linked to one another through quantum entanglement.<br/><br/> While no one knows precisely how these two versions of the same creature\u2019s spirit combine to form an undead vorthuul, those who travel the void know the true dangers these creatures present. Seemingly able to harness the gravitational forces of a black hole, a vorthuul is a horrifying sight for a party of adventurers hoping to loot an abandoned starship or mine precious metals from the surface of an asteroid.<br/><br/> A vorthuul can appear on a starship, research station, or other celestial object when it passes close to a black hole (though not close enough to be caught by the singularity\u2019s gravitational pull), seemingly manifesting as an avatar of the black hole itself. A singularity that has swallowed countless souls might be \u201chome\u201d to a large group of vorthuuls, making the region of space near that black hole particularly dangerous to living creatures. Such collections of vorthuuls often go unreported if no one makes it out of the area alive, leading to rumors of \u201chaunted\u201d stretches of space.<br/><br/> Solarians\u2014especially those of the kasatha species\u2014are especially aware of and concerned with the threat vorthuuls pose. Some solarians believe that many vorthuuls were once members of the same tradition who became disproportionately attuned with graviton forces. Their connection with the cosmic forces of gravity and light became imbalanced, contributing to their rebirth as vorthuuls, and they now seek out living solarians to completely destroy them.<br/><br/> Other groups, such as the Cult of the Devourer, respect the vorthuuls\u2019 uncanny power, viewing them as avatars of their god of infinite destruction, and may even attempt to capture a vorthuul in an attempt to unleash its wrath upon their foes."

The vorthuul decides which of its two forms is dominant at the start of combat and can switch between the forms as a move action.<br/><br/><i>Form of Crushing Tranquility:</i> The vorthuul gains immunity to bludgeoning damage and force effects, as well as a +4 circumstance bonus to Will saves.<br/><br/><i>Form of Everburning Essence:</i> The vorthuul gains elemental immunities and ferocity.",
