            "html": "Spacefarers who frequent the Vast whisper about great cosmic menaces hurtling across the void. According to such reports, these monstrosities are giant metallic spheres traveling in normal space at speeds so fast they preclude engagement. The massive spheres are said to have the ability to sunder asteroids and crack planets, sprouting razor-edged lashes that whirl around them in a lethal flurry. Enough sightings have occurred that authorities are concerned.<br/><br/> The creature\u2019s name, rendalairn, derives from a monster from an old spacefaring tale, but others refer to these creatures as \u201cplanet slayers.\u201d There are two accounts of a rendalairn landing on a planet and starting a rampage that ended only when the construct was done destroying everything it could find, including sapient life. The two targeted worlds, Brimipp\u00c3\u00a9 III and Grixis VI, are home to the ruins of two different technologically advanced but extinct species. Some speculate that rendalairns choose technological societies and sites, which has some people worried at the possibility of such a creature reaching the Pact Worlds or Veskarium.<br/><br/> From observations gathered thus far, rendalairns seem to be specific in their attacks and ignore anything that doesn\u2019t interfere with their intended devastation. During the attack on Brimipp\u00c3\u00a9 III, scavengers recorded the rendalairn\u2019s activity and broadcasts from orbit. In addition to a polite message informing them to maintain a safe distance from the demolition site, which each scavenger heard in their native language, the rendalairn transmitted streams of music, advertisements, or other such random media. Some of this media has since proven to be from pre-extinction Brimipp\u00c3\u00a9 III. On Grixis VI, only some explorers escaped the rendalairn, which broadcasted its warning and then carried out the intended \u201cdemolition\u201d with no concern for bystanders.<br/><br/> No report has yet indicated more than one rendalairn in any one place. They are thought to be solitary. A few scientists have asserted, given the evidence, that \u201cthe\u201d rendalairn is unique. Disparities in description, such as coloration or composition, could be attributed to observational errors. Whatever the case, a rendalairn is spherical with a 30-foot diameter. When its lashes extend, the creature can reach up to 60 feet away. From this data, xenobiologists and engineers have speculated the creature weighs at least 50 tons.<br/><br/> No one is entirely sure when these massive constructs, if more than one exists, first appeared or who created them. The sheer size and complexity of the creatures indicate that significant resources and expertise were invested in their creation. According to reports, a rendalairn has no logos or other identifying marks, besides luminous circular markings that change over time. They have been sighted only in the Vast, which means they come from some far-flung part of the galaxy or, some have conjectured, beyond. The hypothesis that rendalairns are akin to tripods and, perhaps, manufactured by the same species is generally believed to be unlikely, due to the observed broadcasts, but has not been disproved. The mystery surrounding these creatures has prompted explorers and journalists to launch expeditions into the Vast in search of the monstrosities. Most return without significant data. A few have failed to return at all."
