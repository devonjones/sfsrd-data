About two decades ago, a lashunta exploration vessel from Castrovel arrived in Raxil\u2019s system and found the raxilites living in peace, having achieved symbiosis with their world through exceptionally advanced biotechnology.<br/><br/> The curious raxilites sent a delegation back to Castrovel with the lashuntas. The two species have much in common, as raxilites are also intellectual and place great importance on community. After a time on Castrovel, where many raxilites still visit and dwell, the raxilite mission journeyed to Absalom Station. There, they obtained protectorate status for Raxil, just days after the Swarm attack on the Pact Worlds and Veskarium. Raxilites provided aid, mostly in biotech and medicine, during that conflict, though they also helped the Xenowardens advance their biomechanical starship designs. In turn, the raxilites, who lacked starfaring vessels before their contact with the lashuntas, began building their own biomechanical craft.<br/><br/> Today, Raxil is a major source of cutting-edge starship biotech, though most of this tech must be acquired in the Pact Worlds. Raxilites are gentle and gregarious, but they restrict immigration, importing, and tourism to Raxil as carefully as they tend the planet. However, exploration is a key part of raxilite culture. With the galaxy open to them, countless young raxilites leave Raxil to see the stars, which often requires them to adapt to technology built for larger creatures. Raxilite bioengineers invented the Lifting Floret Activation Network (LFAN) augmentation to deal with the issue, and most raxilites have these modifications implanted shortly after sprouting.<br/><br/> When a raxilite reaches adulthood, they sprout a flower. Flowering raxilites are lively and sociable, and especially with modern medicine, a raxilite can spend their entire life flowering. However, most raxilites choose to have children. A raxilite has both male and female reproductive organs, and to reproduce, two or more raxilites gather to exchange pollen. Such raxilites then transition to a seeding stage, with a puffball of seeds like those of a dandelion. Raxilites can also maintain their seeding stage indefinitely, and most do so at least until they find a safe place to plant and sprout their young. After releasing seeds, a raxilite flowers again within a week.<br/><br/> A typical raxilite is 16 inches tall and weighs 4 pounds."
