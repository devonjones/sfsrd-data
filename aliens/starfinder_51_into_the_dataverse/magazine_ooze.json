The soldiers survived the random bursts of fire from unattended weapons, and when they discovered the cause, they affectionately named the oozes \u201cgun jams.\u201d Further research suggests magazine oozes might have been created by an unknown civilization, who developed these devious living weapons to cause havoc among enemy military encampments. Whether or not these creators fell victim to their own inventions, however, remains a mystery."
