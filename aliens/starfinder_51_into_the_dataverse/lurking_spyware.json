Rather than trust valuable data strictly to a hackable server, some enterprises have embedded their data to be accessible via entering digital worlds and contending with one or more programmed guardians.<br/>The demon lord of clocks and prisons, Shivaska, is known to force those she captures to toil in digital realms she hosts. In these places, the imprisoned work ceaselessly to mine a digital currency known as SoulCoin, and corrupt programmed creatures ensure obedience and maintain fear among the digitized prisoners."
