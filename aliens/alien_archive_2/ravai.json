            "html": "The combustion that occurs within a star is one of the most powerful and vital forces in nature. Through its light and heat, a sun provides energy for life on worlds millions of miles away, and organisms that do not in some way rely on these gifts are rare indeed. It seems only natural, then, that such a crucial process should have associated fey. Ravais resemble humanoid grasshoppers with gnarled, plantlike elements\u2014every surface glowing a mottled red and yellow like the surface of the sun seen through a dark filter. Despite their constant glow, ravais aren\u2019t made of light, at least not as most scientists understand it. Instead, ravais generate strong magnetic fields that condense light into something akin to ordinary matter. This condensed light forms a ravai\u2019s physical body and allows it to withstand the internal heat and pressure of even the most massive stars. An average ravai is 5 feet tall and weighs just 85 pounds. Although they are occasionally mistaken for elementals, ravais have no ties to the Plane of Fire, instead dwelling in mysterious settlements inside the stars of the Material Plane.<br/><br/> As the fey embodiment of a star, a ravai can unleash tremendous destruction with the flaming tendrils that peel off its body like coronal mass ejections. But a ravai\u2019s abilities also reflect the nurturing power of solar energy. The same flares of magical energy that might burn an enemy to cinders can also nourish and invigorate plants and other organisms that rely on the sun for energy. Indeed, without resorting to its magical abilities, a ravai can cause nearby plants to bloom and flourish quickly, even in the harshest conditions. First World lore speaks of ancient Material Plane societies that once summoned and bound ravais for terraforming purposes, harnessing and amplifying fey magic with lost technologies. With the advent of Drift travel, some explorers have ventured deeper into the galaxy in search of these ravai-terraformed worlds, but to date, no discoveries have been reported. However, it is said ravais hunt down any who seek to replicate these mislaid methods.<br/><br/> Ravais make their homes inside stars throughout the galaxy, using the immense energies found there to link their Material Plane abodes to similar regions on the First World. However, ravais have a strained relationship with the fey of the First World. Ravai religion holds that their true patron is Apholine the Flame, an Eldest who long ago retreated to live within a sun. Ravais believe that they should follow her model and that she might return to lead them once they fully understand the mystery that led her to withdraw from First World affairs. Until then, they wait, study, and oppose the shadowy fey creatures called ankou, believing the assassin fey to be tainted, umbral reflections of ravai glory, as well as the future architects of a prophesied apocalypse called the Eclipse.<br/><br/> To a ravai, all creatures born in the light of the ravai\u2019s star are that fey\u2019s metaphorical children. Academically minded ravais take an intense interest in the organisms that arise in their Material Plane solar systems. Through magical scrying and the interception of broadcasts, such ravais carefully study the intelligent species of their chosen system, which ravais dub their wards. A ravai scholar learns its wards\u2019 religious practices, magic systems, and popular culture. This knowledge can foster great affection toward members of ward species, but just as often, a ravai observes with scholarly detachment or the excruciating paternalism one might show for a clever but poorly trained pet.<br/><br/> Most ravais stay close to their homes inside stars unless called forth due to great need, summoning magic, or the orders of an Eldest, whom ravais still begrudgingly revere. There exists, however, a particular caste, faction, or life phase of ravais that is much more likely to be encountered among Material Plane residents. Little is known in specific about these wanderers who leave their solar homes to travel the galaxy. They frequently gather members of other intelligent species, as well as numerous plant creatures, to establish sun cults, study aspects of their wards\u2019 cultures, or pursue strange quests. Such wandering ravais are invariably tight mandibled about their motivations, but a recent Starfinder Society report indicates that several different wandering ravais have referred to the act of leaving their home stars as the Tearing, hinting that their missions among Material Plane cultures are at the direction of an interstellar ruling council of ravais called the Prominences."
