A few small starship crews make a dangerous living by following wisps\u2014 at a great distance\u2014and waiting for this molting, scooping up the resulting jewels until their cargo holds are full, and then returning to a safer location to sort them by quality. Despite the danger inherent in collecting the gems, these solarian weapon crystals are widely available, especially in the sun\u2019s Burning Archipelago in the Pact Worlds; aboard the kasathan worldship the <i>Idari</i>; and in Fullbright, Verces\u2019s scorched, sun-facing hemisphere."

Solar wisps are blobs of ejecta from a sun\u2019s corona that have taken on a modicum of sentience. No one is exactly sure how solar wisps originate, though some believe it is Sarenrae\u2019s divine will, while others point toward a consciousness similar to that of elementals, claiming that solar wisps are nothing more than cousins of fire elementals. But while it is true solar wisps are amorphous orbs of burning plasma with almost animal-level intelligence, the similarities end there. These creatures have a long and unique life cycle that begins in a star and can end in calamity.<br/><br/> When a solar wisp is \u201cborn,\u201d it measures about 20 feet in diameter, but the material of its being is loosely held together by minor gravitational forces. At this point, a solar wisp isn\u2019t much more than a red-hot cloud of colloidal matter. Driven by instinct, the solar wisp attaches itself to a nearby fast-moving celestial body (usually a comet), which eventually takes it close to a planet or moon containing the minerals on which the solar wisp feeds. As it burns its way across such a landscape, the solar wisp gains more mass but shrinks in size. Responding to unknown stimuli, the solar wisp launches itself back into space to latch onto another comet or meteor to repeat the process.<br/><br/> As a solar wisp feeds and ages, it increases in density but decreases in diameter. Despite its reduction in size to a mere few feet in diameter, a mature solar wisp burns with far greater intensity and is much more dangerous than a juvenile. A solar wisp of any age and size can pose a threat, however, as it is unwavering in its pursuit of food, consuming the minerals it seeks out in its internal furnace. This can be a destructive process that puts it in conflict with other species\u2014especially if those species also rely on the same minerals for economic stability. Most creatures that attempt to stop a mature solar wisp underestimate its abilities thanks to its small size. Its effects on local gravity and its intense heat mean that most who confront a solar wisp are lucky if they get away with only severe burns.<br/><br/> Though it has a life span measured in centuries\u2014and sometimes multiple thousands of years\u2014a solar wisp does eventually die. An elderly solar wisp is a tiny ball that burns like a nuclear explosion, and when it expires, it implodes into a gravitational singularity that affects a half-mile radius. Though this miniature black hole lasts for less than an hour, it poses a great danger to those caught in its pull. A recent report from Near Space tells of an entire nascent colony wiped out by a dying solar wisp that, until then, had served as a kind of mascot and beacon for the unfortunate settlers."
