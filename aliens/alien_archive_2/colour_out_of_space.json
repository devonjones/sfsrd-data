This entity is composed only of a malevolent hue that defies classification and eludes identification by most sensors. A colour\u2019s presence manifests as an unsettling shifting of colors as it moves through an area. This distortion is enough to allow for targeting of a colour out of space, but the creature\u2019s natural defenses and immunities still make it a high-risk target to engage.<br/><br/> A colour out of space arrives on a planet or other celestial body in embryonic form, infusing the inside of a dense meteorite. After the meteor lands, it crumbles, and the colour seeps out and begins to feed. Once it has fed sufficiently, often over many months, it launches into space again and seeks new feeding grounds. Sometimes, it leaves enough of itself behind to form a new embryonic colour, and the bizarre life cycle continues.<br/><br/> The energies Drift engines exude can nourish a colour out of space. Scholars are only starting to explore what this feeding implies about the nature of the Drift itself."

If the victim failed the saving throw while on a starship, it instead doesn\u2019t willingly travel farther than 1 mile from the starship, nor does it willingly pilot that starship. A <i>break enchantment</i> spell (DC 19) ends the effect, as does moving the victim more than 1 mile from where it failed its save (or from the starship where it failed its save. Every 24 hours, a creature affected by an aura of lassitude can attempt a new DC 19 Will save to cast off the effects of the aura. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to that colour\u2019s aura of lassitude for 24 hours. A creature under the effects of an aura of lassitude from a colour out of space can\u2019t be further affected by this ability from other colours. This is a mind-affecting effect.",

                "text": "As a full action, a colour can attempt to feed on a living creature, a natural region of plant and animal life, or a Drift engine. If it feeds on a creature or a Drift engine, the colour must have line of sight to and be within 300 feet of the target. If it feeds on a region of plant and animal life, it needs only to be within that region. It can feed on a region once per week, a specific Drift engine once per day, and a specific living creature once per day.<br/><br/> Feeding on a region or a Drift engine is automatically successful. When the colour feeds on a region, it causes plant life there to grow brittle and sickly; undergrowth in a blighted region doesn\u2019t provide concealment or function as difficult terrain, and small animals grow larger and deformed. When the colour feeds on a Drift engine, the ship becomes sluggish and awkward; all checks to maneuver the starship (including pilot actions during starship combat) take a \u20134 penalty, and the duration of travel through the Drift is doubled. A colour never completely consumes a region or a Drift engine. A region of nature recovers from these effects 1 year after the colour leaves the area, while a Drift engine recovers 24 hours after the colour\u2019s feeding.<br/><br/> A creature can resist being fed upon by a colour out of space by succeeding at a DC 19 Will save, in which case the colour can\u2019t attempt to feed on that creature again for 24 hours. If the victim fails this saving throw, it takes 1d4 Constitution drain and 1d4 Charisma drain. A creature whose Constitution score is drained to 0 this way immediately dies, crumbling into a mass of desiccated tissue. A creature whose Charisma score is drained to 0 this way gains the colour-blighted graft (see below).",
