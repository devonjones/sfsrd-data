            "html": "During the height of their influence, the kishalee colonized many worlds, bringing with them a versatile stock animal: the docile jubsnuth. When the kishalee civilization fell, these once-domesticated creatures were eventually left to fend for themselves on a variety of worlds and environments. For many herds, this was tantamount to a death sentence, but others survived long enough to evolve into ravaging predators. Though many evolved varieties of jubsnuth now exist on various worlds out in the Vast, they share surprisingly similar traits. Jubsnuths are extremely brutal, carnivorous, dim witted, and territorial.<br/>A jubsnuth is a large, bulbous creature with a pair of mouths, one at the top of its mass and another lower on the body. It moves about on two muscular legs, and a hefty tail serves as a counterbalance for its weight. It uses a mass of jointed appendages lining its underbelly to gather up food. A jubsnuth\u2019s coloration depends on the nature of the world on which it evolved. Many are shades of green to aid in camouflage on planets with foliage of such coloration, though the creature\u2019s size generally makes attempts at stealth useless."

Except for the changes listed, these variants use the same basic statistics as the jubsnuth presented above, but they can be used to create a jubsnuth of any CR. Even more jubsnuth variants may yet exist on uncharted planets throughout the galaxy.<br/><b>Ambush Jubsnuth:</b> These Large jubsnuths lack the swallow whole and trample abilities, and they gain the see in darkness and tracking (scent) special abilities and have Stealth as a master skill.<br/><b>Aquatic Jubsnuth:</b> The legs of these creatures are longer and end in large fins. They have the amphibious and water breathing special abilities, and while their land speeds drop to 10 feet, they gain a 40-foot swim speed.<br/><b>Flying Jubsnuth:</b>These Large jubsnuths have leathery wings instead of legs, giving them an extraordinary fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability but reducing their land speed to 10 feet."
