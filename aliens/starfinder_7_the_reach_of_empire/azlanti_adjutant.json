            "html": "Designed and manufactured long ago by a technomagical robotics firm loyal to the Aeon Throne, adjutant robots are ideal assistants for busy officers: in addition to serving as scribes, valets, and social secretaries, the robots make rapid strategic calculations to aid real-time combat decisions. Centuries ago, when the Aeon Throne mandated the presence of an adjutant robot on all large starships and in every military engagement, most officers were pleased with the aid.<br/><br/> Shortly afterward, rumors began to circulate that the imperially mandated robots were not mere helpers, but spies for the Aeon Throne, recording and transmitting information about their assigned officers to loyalty evaluators. Growing suspicious, many officers began circumventing their adjutant robots when possible. More canny officers reprogrammed their robots to submit only reports favorable to themselves\u2014 and unfavorable to their rivals. Why the Aeon Throne ceased assigning these robots is information lost in the Gap, but the Star Empire hasn\u2019t manufactured a new one in centuries. Some adjutant robots still operate at the fringes of the Azlanti Star Empire, either maintaining their old vigils or assisting\u2014 and still transmitting information on\u2014descendants of remote planetary governors.<br/><br/> Although housing designs of adjutant robots differ, most are humanoid, with four arms able to handle multiple physical tasks simultaneously. Designed to be useful on the battlefield, adjutant robots carry an integrated weapon, have an aeon slot for magical protection, and have tracked wheels instead of feet to handle rugged terrain."

They\u2019re often employed in situations where the risks to living beings are too great or emotional responses are a hindrance\u2014notably murder and war.<br/><br/> Assassin robots are killing machines useful for stealthy slayings or gruesome public displays. A user can program targets into the robot, dispatch the unit, and rest assured. The robot relentlessly pursues its quarry, fearing nothing and using microfiber setae on its hands and feet to traverse vertical and horizontal surfaces with ease. Whether it succeeds, fails, escapes, or suffers destruction, the robot leaves little evidence behind\u2014an assassin robot that is captured or destroyed automatically purges its memory and burns out its sensitive hardware components, making tracing the robot\u2019s mission and origin extremely difficult.<br/><br/> Typical assassin robots are 6 feet tall, weigh 300 pounds, and use the weapons detailed in the stat block on page 108, but they can be outfitted with other armaments as a mission requires. In particular, assassin robots on missions where more subtlety is called for use needler pistols stocked with poisoned darts.<br/><br/> There is nothing subtle, however, about a siege robot. These machines serve as artificially intelligent assault vehicles, and many rightly fear these engines of war. Merciless and efficient, a siege robot is as effective at unloading massive damage against a single target as it is at mowing down enemy troops en masse, and its vehicle form makes it difficult to escape from on an open battlefield. Most siege robots are outfitted with large reserves of ammunition, enough to sustain a constant barrage for minutes at a time."
